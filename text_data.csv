"Fun in short bursts, tedious in long stretches (at the moment).

75% of all the minigames need some sort of rework.

Early game race maps need random factors to make replays feel varied and unpredictable while not being too punishing since they are the first levels. 

Survival games like Roll Out, Block Party, or Perfect Match need to always end based on eliminations, and they need to be faster and harder as right now they are so easy they are a chore.

Team games are basically a random chance that takes 3 minutes to determine whether you won or not because your team's performance is irrelevant to your own individual one. Teams can also be uneven, making your random chance even lower. Fall Ball is also incredibly common because of it's flexible player count requirement, and I'm absolutely sick of this minigame. These are the worst and need to be their own game mode separate from the other game modes.

Right now there are only 3 final levels, Fall Mountain is a race where more often than not the person in the lead stays in the lead because there aren't enough factors to mix up player positions. Royal Fumble is basically luck based depending on whoever in the cluster****  manages to grab the tail within the last 5 seconds. Hex-A-Gone is actually really good. Make these better by transferring survival games here and making them progressively faster until only one person is left standing. 

All these minigame problems could be alleviated by just having more games though. If you lose on a random chance you could at least look forward to what new games you'd play next round, but since things are repeated so often many of the maps feel like a chore. The number of levels increasing is likely to become the case as time goes on, but at the moment it Fall Guys biggest problem. 

Some kind of visual variety in the maps would be appreciated too. After 10+ hours of play the bright colors are all tiring and none of the levels stand out as very unique or creative.

The game also has microtransactions which kinda inherently sucks, and there isn't enough of variety or customization options for costumes to really make you unique and stand out. Every Gordon Freeman costume wearer looks the same, excluding the face color, regardless of your pattern or color. Again, this will hopefully be fixed as more content is added over time.

Most of this review sounds negative, but because of how much fun I had playing it and how much potential it has for the future I think this would be a good game to support and maybe play in moderation right now. If you think the repetitiveness of the maps will be too much for you then hold off for now. The goal is to have this review become outdated simply by adding a substantial amount of new minigames. If this goal is achieved I genuinely think this game might become one of my favorites.

A more in-depth review that goes into every minigame specifically can be found here:
https://youtu.be/u8VbvotlvlI",True
"Here's what I see in this game: potential. Is it the best designed game out there? No. Is it the best multiplayer game out there? No. Is it the best optimized game out there (at least at the time of writing)? No. But what it does have is an amazing base game that's incredibly addicting. Even for the $20 its selling for, which in my opinion is a bit high, it's still a fantastic game that is incredibly fun to play with a group of friends.

Obviously there's a lot missing here: private multiplayer, custom matches, the lack of maps, actually being able to use your own name (lol), and the crackdown on cheating (to be completely fair I haven't encountered any). If you're skeptical about the game, I wouldn't blame you for waiting for it to go on sale or waiting until more content is added. We've seen this song and dance before: games release with a bare bones experience that's wildly fun, but gets old fast. That being said, I hope the developers continue to make this game better and better. Cut them some slack too, they got flooded with a player base they couldn't have expected. Let them get back on their feet after the floodgates opened, and show us what they can do.

Please keep going devs, I'm having a ton of fun so far but it's got a bit of a ways before it's really amazing. 8/10.",True
"It's such a great game. Had fun while playing BUT you need to get rid of the cheaters ASAP!

I hope i don't need to change my review to NOT recommend it... GET RID OF THE CHEATERS, PLEASE!",True
"The Devolverland Expo led me to Fall Guys.  I was a little reluctant to get involved in a Battle Royale style game as I generally suck at competitive play but the sheer gleeful hilarity of this game more than makes up for the frustrations.

Are there server issues? 
Sure.

Are there filthy filthy cheaters? 
Oh you know it!

Am I still terrible? 
Hoo boy am I ever.

Is it filled with bright colours, upbeat music, snappy mini games and lovable characters all bumbling their way to victory or slime?  
Yes, yes it is and I love it.


+++UPDATE+++

So now I've played for, gee forty hours, seriously?  In that time I have managed to win two episodes.  Bear in mind I am terrible.  Two victories out of hundreds of failures.  Sweet sweet victories.  This sounds like a pretty bad ratio but really each victory feels truly momentous especially considering the ever increasing number of cheating hackers.

The cheating was something I could overlook when it was rare, but now it is the norm and it is really making me lose interest.  This is supposed to be Fall Guys, NOT Fly Guys.  There is very little competitive edge when you know the dude who is hovering above the level is going to automatically win!  I am now at the grinding stage just trying to collect the rest of the cosmetics for the season.  

The initial shine has definitely dulled, and unless Mediatonic add some kind of anti cheat, this is going to quickly lose the large casual audience.  We shall see what Season 2 brings, but if the hackers are going to be allowed to continue operating I don't see myself joining the ranks of hopeful suckers never able to get a legitimate win.


===UP-UPDATE===

So now I'm deeper than sixty hours in and Mediatonic have indeed listened to the criticisms levelled at their tiny little behemoth of a game.  There is now an anti cheat running in the background, which I know has been a bone of contention in some other releases (hello DOOM: Eternal) but it was desperately needed here and to be fair, I haven't happened upon any filthy dirty hackers since.  So now I can get back to being terrible through my own volition.

There has also been a refreshing of the levels.  A remixing of sorts.  The old tried and tested games have been given a lick of fresh paint and are all just a little bit different.  Clockwise rotating beams now might rotate anti-clockwise.  Wrecking balls that swung along the x axis now might swing along the y axis.  And there are random spinning hammers all over the shop.  It has definitely breathed fresh life into the game and really all my previous complaints have now been addressed.

Jolly well played there chaps.  Good form indeed.

GO HACK ON COMPETITIVE CS:GO SO AS TO PROVE YOUR HACKING SKILLS PLEASE/// Nevertheless, I'm still hoping to see more maps and challenges. Still recommendable to get it if it was a tad cheaper.",True
"The hacking has ruined the game, won't recommend until reporting and anti-cheat gets better",False
"Update 9.19.20 || The devs have addressed the cheating issue and have finally added EAC, which has helped to alleviate the cheating problem. I'm still going to leave this review as it was at the time that I wrote it to stand as testament to how terrible this game was on release. 

I still don't recommend this game. I have zero faith in these developers. The anticheat took far longer than it should have to be added and all the other issues with this game still remain unaddressed. 

PS, usernames are STILL disabled. I'm pretty confident the developers have no intention of re-enabling them. RIP grabbing ttv streamers, it was the only truly fun thing to do in this game. 

//

This game's launch has been an absolute trainwreck.

THE GAME RUNS ENTIRELY CLIENT-SIDE, which means people can blatantly speedhack with no special hack tools. The game also has NO ANTI-CHEAT, AT ALL. The closest thing to anti-cheat is a single text channel in the game's official Discord where you can manually report cheaters, which, surprise, doesn't actually get any cheaters banned. 

Users were able to use HTML in their Steam username to make their names appear large or colorful in-game. I never once saw this used for anything malicious yet the developers went nuclear and decided that, RATHER THAN FIXING the html injection, to just force every single player's in-game name to ""Fall Guy ####"". WHY NOT JUST FIX THE HTML IN USER'S NAMES. Let me give your programmers a hint, it's called input sanitization, you can look up a tutorial for it on YouTube and actually do your job.

So with those two problems coupled together, yeah let me just go and file a report against someone with nothing but the username ""Fall Guy 1234"" to go on—I can't even track their Steam account through recent games. Keep in mind also that this game has a million-some players and there are only 4 digits in each randomized name, so there are going to be several dozen duplicates of each numerical name. The devs couldn't track that to a player even if they wanted to, so no one is getting banned for cheating. Great work guys. It's only going to get worse as the game goes on if nothing gets fixed. 

This game has the worst netcode of any game I've ever played. There's a gamemode that involves running around the map and stealing tails from other players. This minigame was copy-pasted twice to make three equally garbage modes, I've heard dozens of complains against them from friends and streamers and I don't think a single person actually enjoys playing them. Enemies with Walmart parking lot tier internet can grab you from over 10 feet away and when you attempt to grab the tail off an enemy you can see the grab icon pop up on their character and nothing happens 50% of the time. It's so inconsistent that there's almost no skill here, just pure luck. 

Nobody enjoys the forced team gamemodes either. You only have a small amount of control to the outcome of team games, so winning equates to a simple game of luck based on how bad your teammates are. In addition to that, this is a physics-based game, using Unity's default physics engine. It's horrifically inconsistent and sometimes your character will simply trip over their own feet, falling down and losing the game because someone grabs your tail while you're on the floor, or you jump down a level on Hex-a-gone and your character simply trips for no reason and you fall to your death while you try to stand up. The physics make the game feel horrible to play. Half of the minigames feel like they were quickly thrown together in the last 2 weeks of development to meet quota. Especially ""Perfect Match"", the game where no one ever dies unless they're literally afk. 

Only *one day* after releasing, the game's servers completely died, for absolutely everyone, for almost an entire day. They had previously been dropping constantly in the middle of games. The devs' had presumably been attempting to migrate their servers to a different host with a larger capacity, but apparently failed to do so and were being very secretive as to why. They had announced a maintenance would begin at 6:00 am, but randomly decided to begin six hours early at peak player count time and gave no ETA for when it would be finished. The ""maintenance"" ended up taking almost the entire day and no one could play the game the entire time. When the game first officially released they deliberately avoided announcing the time that the game would unlock. They also avoided notifying players when the servers were back online after the ""maintanance"". They clearly knew the servers would choke on the first day and didn't fix the servers in the three day period before the game launched, or, you know, several months before, they had ample reason to predict this would be a problem but did nothing.  

My favorite part of it all is that the developers are BLAMING THE PLAYERS for their problems. On Twitter they blamed the players when the servers went over capacity, clearly their fault, and they blamed the players when users used html in their names, also clearly their own fault. Fix your game. 

The game has a separate Twitter account for the server status. Not only has the account constantly lied about the status of the servers, in addition to claiming they ""would tweet when the servers are back online"" and then didn't, I thought it was pretty hilarious that the main Twitter playfully posted something along the lines of ""Look how many people are following our server account!"". Yeah, no, they're not following that because they want to hear your awful hello-fellow-kids tweets, they're doing it because they want to know when the servers are going to be back online for the game they all paid $20 for.  

The devs had MONTHS to beta test this game and somehow bafflingly didn't catch on to the fact that the servers wouldn't have enough capacity to handle the amount of players on launch. Or fix the broken netcode. Or add anticheat. Or fix html in usernames. Or rework the bad minigames. I refuse to believe this kind of stuff wasn't caught in QA, which means either there was no QA, or the devs just ignored the feedback.  

I've never seen a company shoot themselves in the foot and handle success so poorly.

And to the people claiming that this is excusable because ""they're just a small indie company"", it isn't, because they're not. They have 230 employees and have existed since 2005. This is pure incompetence. I don't see this game lasting past its first season.",False
"I got this game as a gift from a buddy of mine and honestly It's a blast to play. The characters are super cute, the music keeps me hyped up and though for some, I've heard that the servers are a big issue, it hasn't hindered my experience too much. Even with the occasional server disconnects, it's been fairly easy to just hop into a new game. The only main issue I've had is lag but, with the Fall Guys team diligently doing maintenance on the game, I'm confident that these kinds of issues will be resolved with time.",True
wish there was an 8 party option,True
Netflix anime adaptation of Takeshi's Castle,True
"I guess I get to write a review for this right away because my ""review after finishing a game"" policy doesn't apply here as Fall Guys is a game that never ends and I hope just keeps going on forever.  It's a cute battle royale which I haven't had the pleasure of playing since Mario Party or something like that.  Every woman, man and his dog already knows about Fall Guys so let's just get down to brass tacks.

[h1] PROS [/h1]

+  Fun with a capital F.  Everything is colourful and playful and when I played each time the servers were pretty fast.  

+  room for improvement.  We are in season 1 now and I hope that next seasons come with new maps.  There is a huge window of opportunity to keep the game fresh and therefore the play-count high.  The devs are going to have to really focus on this aspect because at 60 players per room, that's a helluva goal to set to keep this game alive.  But to be fair when you have a bunch of seasons of Wipeout and Takeshi's Castle to draw from for inspiration then we are all set for a few years I think.

+  maps.  There are a lot of maps but I haven't experienced them all yet in my 4 hours.  Some are better than others but everyone will have their own preferences.  Some maps are hectic scrums, others require a bit more platforming savvy techniques, others yet have a more physical dexterity aspect.  There is something for everyone.

+  microtransactions are purely cosmetic and offer no bonuses to the players.  There are a bunch of skins you can buy or grind out using the in-game currency, Kudos.  But there is nothing I can see that offers a speed or jumping bonus, etc.  Just MTX to keep funding the game once saturation of the player base has been reached, I suppose.

-------------------------

[h1] CONS [/h1]

-  names.  EVERYONE has a username of fallguy XXXX where X=numbers.  I want to put my own name in there.  I want to see my friends I am playing with.  I want to know that b'stard that pushed me off a ledge.  

-  controls.  The controls seem a bit too sluggish for me.  Changing direction or trying to grab something can feel like you are doing it through a pool of syrup.

-  hackers ruin everything.  I have only seen a couple but they are out there and they are x10 faster than us, they begin before the starting gun fires, they jump higher and further than us and it is zero fun watching them take the crown.

"It's really funny to play with friends, but i don't have any.",True
"There's no doubt Fall Guys deserves every ounce of the hype it's receiving - the game is ridiculously fun and an absolute blast to play alone or alongside a handful of friends, easily knocking Gang Beasts and similar titles off of their pedestals.

I trust Mediatonic will listen to the outcry for new levels, balancing, and content... but Fall Guys [b]will[/b] inevitably get repetitive and boring in the long run. For this reason, I encourage them to say attentive to community feedback and not fall into the void of trend-games; to do so, Fall Guys could follow in these three steps:


[b]Step One - Essentials[/b]

To begin, there's clearly a few minor issues with the game that most people are reporting across all platforms - notably regarding team games. Working together to complete objectives is fun, but individual skill currently holds no weight when qualifying for the next round.

Solving this is straightforward; team games should stay, but players may individually qualify throughout the round if they score enough points or hold the objective for enough seconds. Playing team games during a semi-final is very disappointing, since it's hard to shake the feeling that you may not qualify for the finals due to a rogue teammate.

Aside from team games, the majority of the minigames are hilarious, but I really hope that we don't have to wait for the end of the season for new maps. Seasons are around 60 days long which concerns me since there's a chance that we'll be in the same rotation of maps for another 2 months.


[b]Step Two - Update and Innovate[/b]

Undoubtedly, the most obvious way to maintain an active playerbase is to add new maps and skins, but this option can only be done so much before stagnating - I really want to see Fall Guys reaching the numbers it's doing right now around this time next year. To do this, Mediatonic need to be actively innovating and bringing in new features beyond the base game. Examples include:

[i]8-player Parties[/i]

Doubling the party size would be a great first non-map/non-cosmetic update - this currently being the main barrier holding back a few of my friends from buying, since our group cannot fit in a single party.

[i]New Moves[/i]

Controlling your Fall Guy is genius in its simplicity. Jumping, diving, and grabbing seem basic on the surface, but play a huge role in finding shortcuts, eliminating other players or getting a final boost of speed before reaching the finish line. However, as there are still many unused keys on both keyboard and controller, it'd be great to throw in an extra move or two.

One idea may be a high risk, yet high reward 'punt' button, allowing you to kick over a nearby opponent after a few seconds of charging up. However, missing a kick would cause your character to tumble forward, leaving them at risk to obstacles or other players.

[i]Weekly Event Days[/i]

Counter-Strike's War Games and Fortnite's LTM's opened up a new market for developers to satisfy niches in their audience, but tend to be stale and unexciting after a while.

Rather than sticking to the cookie-cut format of scattering limited-time modes throughout the year, Mediatonic could innovate by claiming a specific day of the week, introducing a unique spin on the entire game for 24 hours. '100-player Fridays' may be feasible; a once-a-week alternative to standard 60 player matches, containing exciting minigames tailored for larger groups alongside prodigious rewards for those who secure the crown. Providing the community with interesting spins on standard gameplay in small but addictive chunks may assist Fall Guys in moulding into [i]""that game we always play on Fridays""[/i], gradually shifting towards a lifestyle game that keeps people coming back to play week by week.

[i]Streamer Lobbies[/i]

Streamers will often return to games that enable them to play with their community, or host games such as 'Marbles On Stream' allowing active viewers to compete for personalised gifts such as a paid subscription, shout-out, or merchandise. With minimal crossover in this niche already, Fall Guys has an opportunity to grant streamers the ability to open a private lobby - rather than compete for crowns, viewers instead join through a room code and compete for a predetermined prize at the discretion of the streamer.


[b]Step Three - Sustaining Beyond 2020[/b]

With a mixture of luck and commitment, Fall Guys could become a smash hit, continuing to flourish over many years. Without getting too ahead of themselves, Mediatonic could consider opening their game up to the Steam workshop later down the line so players can upload their own maps and modes for approval. This way, Fall Guys is never short of quality content and unique ideas for the years to come!


To summarise, Fall Guys is awesome yet still has legroom to grow even bigger and better. In spite of expected day one issues, Fall Guys is far from being just another washed up gimmick, on the exception that Mediatonic really knuckle down on content and balancing [b]before[/b] the first season ends.

• Fast & short matches (If you're eliminated in the early stages you can stick around in spectator mode)
• Stupidly fun! Even bugs can be silly at times which will make you giggle every time.
• It's going to be even better if you have some friends to party up but it's good solo as well.

• [u]As a side note[/u]: It's got a store in-game which asks a little bit too much for some of the items. You can earn in-game currency, though, but it requires a bit of grinding on the player's part.

"[h1][b]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout - a virtual mirror for human behaviour![/b][/h1]

[h1]Let the games begin[/h1]

Imagine 60 brightly coloured jelly beans, all dressed up in grotesquely jumbled up costumes and with the same goal - a golden crown. The winner is determined by 3 types of mini-games: race, survival and team. Each next task depends on how many players are still competing. You can run, jump, do a racing dive and grab - that´s it. As in real life everyone lives out their character. You will be pushed into the abyss, jostled, attacked by teams, be held and finally mocked before the finish line. Please also welcome the fraudulent plague of the digital age that is literally flying over the cuckoo's nest. And ultimately the game physics, based on loss of movement control, ensures mass collisions and gives you the rest.

In a nutshell: 60 beans line up, one wins.

[h1]+/-[/h1]

+ Takeshi´s Castle style
+ play with up to 3 friends
+ quick matchmaking
+ fast games - max 15-20 minutes to the crown I didn´t get once
+ rumbling jelly beans
+ hilarious fun and absurd situations
+ free season pass
+ customization - costumes, emotes, victory poses etc.
+ more hilarious fun and even more absurd situations
+ watch remaining players after reaching the finish line or even when you´re out

+/- easy to learn but(t) hard to master - did I mention I never got a single crown?!!
+/- monetization for cosmetics and the game currency Kudos
+/- your starting position can make the small but subtle difference, rotation makes it fair
+/- after 1-2 hours you know all mini-games, but more are announced

- There´s nothing really negative to say about Fall Guys. Yes, there are cheaters, but show me a multiplayer game where these dishonorable beings don´t show up. And yes, the unexpected success of Fall Guys initially completely overwhelmed the servers and you still may experience a disconnect or lag here and there. So what, go for the next round. Unfortunately there is a trend for negativity in reviews and forums these days because people have neither understanding nor patience anymore. And in the end all depends on how developers communicate with their player base and solve problems. They did a great job so far and seem to really care about their game.

[h1]Is Fall Guys worth your time and money?[/h1]

Absolutely! It´s screamingly funny and the first so-called Battle Royale that I enjoy. No ranking lists, no weapons to master and in lack of a chat no russian pet names for your mother. Fall Guys definitely is the multiplayer feast of this summer that nobody expected. So join the party or be a party pooper.",True

"as much as I enjoy the game Its just rampant with hackers. The discord removed the report hackers channel because they had ""implemented their anticheat"" which if you read on their website, once they activate their cheats they're flagged.

 ""The likelihood is, if you saw a cheater, it was their first and probably their last time cheating - they tripped our anti cheating switch and the next game they have been detected.""

is what it says on the support website.  I got the same hacker twice in a row, I know this because they had the exact same outfit as before. 

I'm not good at writing reviews and this is more of a grievance thing.  On top of those problems are the latency issues when you get grabbed or pulled 3 fall guys away (I'm using fall guys as measurements.) and they quickly run off with your tail and you're unable to catch up with them. Also momentum seems very inconsistent, at times I'm moving at the same speed as another person coming in my direction and I'm suddenly pushed away with quite the force that knocks me down. other times people are flung at me which causes me to fall on stages like block party.

At the end of the day sure its a game to just have fun but with the hacking happening and other in game shenanigans it makes it less enjoyable. 

As for if you want to report a hacker, here's the link to the fall guys support page about hackers.

Edit: As of August 24, I've encountered strange incidents in game. During Rock 'N Roll I was on the red team and blue had already got their ball in. Red and yellow got the balls in at the same time and I was eliminated. It showed a random blue player winning the crown.

Another incident was during Fall ball and the score was 0-0 as both teams were actively defending their goals, it went into overtime and not 10 seconds after that the whole yellow team was eliminated. 

I have sent a support ticket to find out what this is all about but I doubt I'll hear back from them. I just want to know what the mechanics behind ties and stalemates are because for the last one it just seemed like they picked one team to eliminate and moved on.  I never encountered this during the beta so I'm mostly curious.",False

I been addicted for 2 days now and I'm still going so there might be something wrong with me lol..

Overall I can see myself spending hours upon hours playing this game and it looks like the game will always stay updated for new maps and costumes for your character. The physics and and the jumping and bumping against each other is hilarious to see. The competitiveness is definitely there for a battle royale and your always wanting to play ""one more"" after you finish your game and then realize its freaking late as hell and you have work in the morning LOL.

"[h1]Not worth the Price[/h1]

+ Very cute visually with vibrant colors
+ The events are mostly well designed and fun
+ Addictive replayability trying to someday be #1
+ Great fun to see 60 players competing at the start of each game


- Not enough events. Even as a new player, after a few games you will be repeating events, after about 10 games you will have experienced everything this game has to offer.
- Starts to feel a bit repetitive after about 1 hour (in my experience)
- In-game cash shop


Overall, is it fun? Yes, for a limited short time.  With the current amount of content available within Fall Guys, I would have priced this game at around $5.  If they decide to add (A LOT) more content later on, than perhaps this game is justifiable at $20, but currently I wouldn't imagine playing Fall Guys for more than about 2 hours.


*Voted Positive, because the game is truly fun, and I don't want to bash it just for the price*",True
[h1] Fall Guys Ultimate Knockout is a massively multiplayer party game with up to 60 [strike] players [/strike] [b] hackers [/b] online in a free-for-all struggle through round after round of escalating chaos until one [strike] victor [/strike] [b] cheater [/b] remains! [/h1],True
"I'll start off with saying this is FAR from a bad game, and definitely has potential to be a great and fun experience, but right now it just has some glaring issues that really put me off from playing more than just a few games, I heavily encourage you to look up more reviews and gameplay to decide if it's something for you but here's what nags me personally;

[h1]Repetitiveness[/h1]
Right now it's difficult for me to really keep going as you keep seeing the same maps over and over in just a few hours of playtime, and most of these involve running forward from one end to the other before X amount of players do, with the inspiration this game draws from Takeshi's Castle this is understandable, but I feel like more could be done in this regard to make the average game more varied.

[h1]Team games feel awful[/h1]
Generally I enjoy the game in short bursts, but I have absolutely never enjoyed any of the team games, it honestly just feels like a 2 minute wait to roll your 66% or 50% chance to not be eliminated, this isn't helped by the fact teams can be uneven in terms of player numbers and objectives spawning at random in some of these minigames, I really wish there was an option to opt out of these.

[h1]Winning as a currency[/h1]
This is entirely subjective, but I hate this, of course there's skill involved but winning is mostly a random ordeal from my experience, yet there's time-limited cosmetics you can only obtain by winning 10 or so games, quickly shifting the focus from lighthearted fun to just getting annoyed if you don't get the crown should you be interested in any of those cosmetics. I really wish there was no arbitrary time limit on these things or another way to get the currency so you can steadily progress, the pressure to win is something I don't enjoy in a casual party game, of course reward the winner but please don't lock things solely behind winning games.

[h1]Final rounds are very discouraging.[/h1]
Currently there are 3 minigames for the final round to decide the winner, two of these feel utterly pointless to me as one of them is a race, but you spawn in 2 rows, if you don't spawn in the first row you've generally lost from the second it starts. The other game involves holding an item when a timer runs out, which generally just results in running in a circle for 2 minutes, only to end up in a clump of people for the last few seconds, mashing the grab button and praying you have the thing when the clock runs out, which is more frustrating than anything. The third game is one I actually enjoy where you need to move across disappearing platforms in multiple layers to avoid falling down, the last one standing wins, this doesn't feel as random or reliant on luck and makes for a much more fun experience, I hope more final minigames follow this trend.


All that said, I'm still excited to see where this game goes, as new maps and minigames are already planned, and I'm already very close to recommending the game.",False
Too many hackers ruin such a silly game.  Only takes one in a batch of 60 to ruin all the fun.  I doubt it will change so unless you like backing out of half the games then I wouldn't spend $20 on this.,False

"Have you ever wondered what shows such as Wipeout or Takeshi’s Castle would look like in Video Game form? Say hello to Fall Guys since that’s essentially what it is, and boy is it fun. 

[h1]What I like:[/h1]

+ Fall Guys has a wide variety of games that provide their own set of challenges. They’re not all brilliant, but they stand out and are entertaining. Some people say there aren’t enough games, but personally I think there’s enough to justify the price.

+ Fall Guys isn’t a complex game. Each level has a simple goal, whether it being to jump over obstacles or bash through the right door and reach the finish line. The overall objective is to qualify each round until you reach the final round for the ultimate victory. Given time, anyone can pick this up and eventually win a game.   

+ The game has a colourful art style that is very effective at luring people in and hiding how frustrating the game can be. The visual design of the levels, although simple, is nice to look at, and the character designs are iconic. 

+ The game is challenging. Fall Guys will inevitably get you angry at some point, whether it’ll be because of the wacky physics or somebody getting in the way. It’s both the silliness and the competitiveness that make this game really fun to play.

+ As well as being challenging, it’s also addicting. Sure, it doesn’t take long to end up playing the same games again and again but that didn’t bother me much because each round felt different. It’s all dependant on who you’re put up against. 

+ There is a vast amount of customisation items for your character, ranging from colours, patterns and outfits. The devs regularly introduce cross over events with other games. At the time of writing, they have done TF2, Portal 2 and Enter the Gungeon. There is also a free battle pass that gives you cosmetics as you progress.        

[h1]What I don’t like:[/h1]

- Team games are definitely hit or miss. Sometimes they’re great. Sometimes they’re awful. The problem is that people leave as soon as their team is losing, screwing over the people who are trying. I don’t mind team games, but it would be nice if there could be two types of match searches; one type being solo games only, and the other being a mix of the two.

- I can’t say I like the tail games. The hitboxes for them seem really inconsistent. There were times where I should’ve grabbed the tail but the game failed to detect it. That or I’m just really bad. It could be that.

- Although not as bad as they used to be, server issues are still prevalent. Disconnects and lag spikes will happen every so often. Speed hackers and cheaters are also a problem. Yes people hack in this game, it's incredible really. 

[h1]My Overall Thoughts:[/h1]

Fall Guys has become insanely popular since release and I can understand why. It’s a unique take on a battle royale that manages to make the genre enjoyable to people who despise it. The fact that it still has a massive playerbase shows that the devs did many things right.

As I mentioned before, it’s the silliness and competitiveness in each round that make this game enjoyable and memorable. It’s meant to be frustrating. It’s meant to be over the top. And it’s really damn fun. The game has a charm that I personally haven’t seen much of in multiplayer games.

That being said, the game is far from perfect. Fall Guys had a rough launch server wise and still has a way to go. It also has a hacker problem which is in the process of being fixed. The game still needs some new features such as advanced searches as well as tweaks to already existing game modes. 

Fall Guys isn’t necessarily a game you will play for a prolonged period of time, but it’s a brilliant pick if you want something to spend the time. It’s great on your own and it’s great with friends, and with its current price tag, I’d say it’s worth it.

[h1]My Final Rating:[/h1]
[b]8/10.[/b]

[quote]Get high quality, short reviews by following [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36143846/]Balance Patch.[/url][url=https://discord.gg/YEq9cmj]Talk games with us on Discord[/url][/quote]",True
"NECESSARY PREMISE: The game needs a better anti-cheat system. Stumbling into cheaters that make the game worse for everyone is becoming increasingly frequent and it can't be solved by simply stating that ""if you meet a cheater, this is likely their first and last time cheating"". If you play 10 games and meet 10 different first-and-last-time cheaters, you'll still have 10 games ruined. Do better, Mediatonic and Devolver.

That said, the game itself is brilliant in its simplicity. The idea is quite straight-forward—a battle royale game based on the Takeshi's Castle formula, easy to access and fun to play both for less-experienced and hardcore players, it still requires a bit of strategy to master all the different events. Most of the mini-games are polished and fun to play and are varied enough to keep the game fresh during its first season. It's yet to be seen how Mediatonic will handle the following seasons and if they'll mange to introduce enough modes and events to keep Fall Guys entertaining, what we've seen so far about the medieval theme for Season 2 seems like a first step in the right direction.

A must-have game for everyone... except for those who fear they'd have their 'hardcore gamer' license revoked, I guess.",True
"~ THIS REVIEW IS IN ENGLISH AND IN SPANISH ~~ ESTA REVISIÓN ES EN INGLÈS Y EN ESPAÑOL ~⚠️ Facts: 1) This game has over 45,482+ Negative Reviews.2) Despite high sales & lots of hype about the game it hasn't been able to obtain the coveted rating of ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" due to substantial Negative reviews.3) DLC's reviews are mixed. A lot of players paid for them, but haven't received them. Once purchased the money will not be refunded. The DLC's for this game are a Final Sale !4) Doesn't feature a ""Friends Only Mini-Games Mode"" and instead to play with friends you're forced to join random players as well to add up to 60 players at all times.5) No In-Game Chat feature.6) Hard to Connect and Disconnecting from the game ongoing issues.7) Fun game for all ages to laugh & rage 😂😠 8) Developers manipulate reviewsThis game is a lot of fun and looks like the developers are on to a game that can be a classic must have game in every Steam library, especially for players that like me love multi-player games. It's well made and I love the vibrant colors, the map challenges, the silly and cute costumes I've seen in-game and the overall concept of the game. It's hard joining games cause of the ongoing connecting and disconnecting issues happening from day one, but I do have a lot of fun on the games that I'm able to play. When gane begins it's pure madness making me laugh & rage. Unfortunately some players pull hacks on the last map, making the game harder to win. Developers have yet to solve this ongoing issue. I think this game wasn't ready for release as a finished game yet. It definitely needs work and I consider  that this game has more than connecting issues, because it's also missing key features to truly enjoy such a fun game to the fullest. The selling price is high it should be more like $9.99 - $11.99 price range. The DLC's are insanely expensive and to me that should be part of items to be unlocked as we advance in the game like it's in the game Golf With Your Friends which keeps us players motivated to keep playing the game.  I want to point out that if players don't like the game Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, Steam will only refund the game, but you're stuck with the DLC's as they will not refund the money for them, which is extremely unfair and greedy to do to players. In other words they force you to keep the game by not offering a return on the DLC's. My opinion after talking to friends who bought the DLC's is that they aren't worth buying. I was excited to play this game and so when I bought my game, I also gifted it to 6 of my friends. Unfortunately our experience was nothing, but frustration with the game because we spent very long periods of time waiting for servers.  Everyone got upset and  kept leaving unable to start a game. When I invited friends to play, they had no names to identify who had joined me in the lobby and instead a tag saying fall guy and some numbers, which still gave me no clue of who was who in the lobby. By the way I didn't have a name tag either. I also hated that when a game starts the only one showing free falling it's me, so I had no clue of who would actually made it into my server and would be in the game with me, unlike in the game Human Fall Flat where me and my friends are all shown free falling as an indication that we are all in the same server and the game will be starting. My friends advancement was also hard to track once the game started, so I felt like I was playing alone. There is no ""In Game Chat"" feature which makes it hard to talk in game, because you must exit the game to chat to friends through Steam chat which hurts your game play. I'm also dissapointed that unlike the game Pummel Party I can't create private challenges between me and my friends only. Another negative is too many players (60) making it super hard to advance. We the players should decide how many players we want to compete against in random multiplayer games or private games if we are ever lucky enough to have the developers listen and add private games between friends. This game doesn't feature ""Play with Friends Only  Mode"". If you want to play with friends random players will be added to the game to complete 60 playes at all times. I suggest that the developers take advantage of the fact that we Steam Players are excited about  Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout & make the necessary improvements to make this game function the way it should be after all the sales they've had and not just create more skins for the game characters and instead fix the connection issues, add in-game chat, add friends only mini-game challenges, create more maps, stop selling us DLC's instead have us unlock costumes as we advance in the game as an incentive to keep playing, after inviting our friends to play feature us free falling together at start of games as an indication that we are all connected in the same server and have our names shown above our characters in game so we can identify our friends at all times. We players deserve this features after investing in your company by purchasing this game. Developers please look into the games, Human Fall Flat, Pummel Party,  Rocket League and Golf With Your Friends, because all of these games have the things Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout game lacks and you can learn a lot from them as they are all a total success and we players love them because of the many in game features that they all offer to us. ❤🌹😊REVISION EN ESPAÑOL :Este juego es divertidisimo y tiene un gran potencial de ser uno de esos juegos que todos queremos tener en nuestra bibioteca.de Steam, si los developers terminan los detalles basicos que le faltan para considerlo perfecto. El precio esta alto y deberia ocsilar entre los $9.99 y $11.99. Tambien venden DLC's con accesorios a un precio altisimo y no valen la pena. Deben ser parte de regalos que obtienes cuando avanzas de nivel a nivel de incentivo como en el juego Golf With Your Friends. Tambien quiero prevenirlos de que si no te gusta el juego lo puedes devolver pero los DLC's del juego no pueden ser devueltos y esto es una manera de forzarte a que no devuelvas el juego si no te gusta. Una decision muy avara y no honesta para los compradores de DLC's. Tambien tengo problemas al no poder connectarme con el juego por dias al igual de que si finalmente me connecto termina desconectandome una situaciőn frustrante. Los juegos en que me conecte fueron divertidos y caőticos. Te reiras y te dara mucho coraje. Tampoco vez los nombres de tus amigos en el pasillo mientras invitas a tus amistades o durante el juego. Es dificil saber quien de tus amigos esta en tu server y cuando empieza el juego localizar a tus amigos es una odisea y te sientes que estas jugando solo(a) todo el tiempo. Tampoco puedes jugar juegos privados solo con amigos como en el juego Pummel Party o hablar con tus amistades dentro del juego. Para hablar durante el juego tienes que salirte del juego y hablar usando Steam Chat y eso afecta el progreso de tu juego. Cuando finalmente te connectas al juego (si tienes suerte!) te ves caer al vacio pero no a tus amigos como en el juego Human Fall Flat que te deja saber todos estan en tu server. Otro negativo es demasiados jugadores (60) y eso declina las oportunidades de ganar. Es mejor si nosotros los jugadores podemos decidir con cuantos jugadores queremos jugar en partidos random y  con  amistades en juegos privados. Los developers deben aprender de juegos como Pummel Party, Golfing With Friends, Human Fall Flat y Rocket League  y aprovechar que el auge del juego esta en su apogeo y arreglar y añadir lo que este juego necesita para poder disfrutarlo  al maximo. Definitivamente no malgasten dinero comprando los DLC's y por favor tomen el tiempo para escribir una revisión y exigir que se complete el juego y se añadan los detalles necesarios al juego para que todos podamos disfrutar Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout a un 100%. Suerte con el juego ! ❤🌹😊",True

For some reason this game reminds me of that old japanese TV show 'Takeshi's castle' where also, 50 or more competitors, have to go through a series of obstacle parcours and who makes it to the finale can play the finale. 
Only difference was that all competitors didn't had to go through the obstacle parcours all at once, and this is what this game makes so much fun, 
Imagine 60 players all together trying to be the first to squeese through a moving door, or how you will always fail to balance a platform to move to the next.
Every obstacle parcour or level task in this game is worth to play it, even losing is fun.

"The game is a lot of fun and it should deserve all the thumbs up. But after a while I have noticed a few things that make the game more frustrating to play and if those things don't get changed I can't see myself continue to play this game in the future. 
Keep in mind that some of the points are heavily based on my personal preference. So depending on what type of player you are, you might see things completely different. 

[h1]The good[/h1]
[list]
[*] Game is fun
[*] Rounds are fast which makes losing less frustrating
[*] Playing with friends makes it even more enjoyable 
[*] Watching your friends play when you get kicked out before is also fun
[*] Winning the game feels rewarding because you earn crowns which let you buy cosmetics that you cannot get otherwise
[*] For the most part good maps and game modes
[/list]

[h1]The not so good[/h1]

[b]Inconsistency[/b]
For me the most frustrating part of the game is the inconsistency. You can jump on the same slope four times in a row and be just fine. Do it the fifth time and your bean starts tripping and tumbling. Do a dive and be able to stand up just fine and fast enough 80% of the time. But the other 20% it takes just slightly longer than usual for some reason which makes a huge difference in some of the maps and often lead to a lose. Bumb into another player and nothing happens. Let the other player walk up to you, it might send you flying across the map. Stuff like this does happen constantly. And it is especially frustrating if you lose your game because something doesn't work which have worked the same way just fine before. 

[b]Team games with unfair teams[/b]
The team games are in general a mixed bag. While some are fun, your success is heavily depending on what your team mates are doing. Some games are even so easy to manipulate that one troll in your team can throw the whole round for you. Even worse than that is the fact that the game constantly manages to put up team games when it is not possible to divide the amount of players fairly around the teams. 90% of the time the team with less players loses. And I absolutely don't understand how this is a thing. After each round a certain amount of players proceeds. The game could just do a simple check of how many players are still alive and if it is possible to divide them up properly. But it doesn't. Almost every team game you will play there is a high chance that either your team or another team has less players. This makes me believe that the devs either didn't care or thought that this was just fine. The best thing you can do in that situation is just to leave the round and save your time to start another match. It would be more fun to watch the game rolling a die and lose the game just because it did not roll your number. 

[b]The game is too easy[/b]
Some of the game modes and maps are just too easy and boring. ""Roll Out"" is basically a giant roll on which you run around from left to right and try to stay on top while the roll is rotating. The roll is way too slow and the only way to lose is by falling a sleep or jumping down in the slime just to be done with it. ""Roll Out"" needs to increase the speed of the rotation, increase the gaps or put in a timer. ""Block Party"" is similar. Too slow and it's too easy to get around the obstacles. While I like the idea of ""Perfect Match"", it is super easy because you can just see where everyone else is going to be safe. 
The races in general are also too easy. ""Slime Climb"" is the best map the game has to offer. While it is also a race, there is ""lava"" slowly rising. This map is actually a bit difficult to get through. You need to be patient but also fast. And unlike the other race maps, this one is not about just glitching your way through everybody to qualify. More race maps should be like this. Fall off the course and you lose. 

[b]Other annoying things[/b]
[list]
[*] The tail tag maps are boring and frustrating. You have to be real close to another player to get his tail but other players can grab your tail from far away. I assume it's because of latency issues but it makes these modes especially frustrating. In addition they are not really that much fun. 
[*] The final stage ""Royal Fumble"" is just a complete mess. Its tail tag game, so it has the latency problem, but in addition this round always ends up in the remaining players just jumping into each other, spamming the grab button and someone randomly gets the tail in the last second and wins. Again, rolling a die would be more fun. 
[*] Some maps rely heavily on people sacrificing themselves so that others win. ""See Saw"" is just annoying because a lot of people apparently never visited a Kindergarten and don't understand basic physics. So it can happen that someone has to be the one to stand on one side of a see saw to keep it balanced while that person can not continue from that point. ""Tip Toe"" has the problem that people have to find a hidden path but more and more people are just waiting for someone to sacrifice themself to find the way. 
[*] Fruit Chute... I really don't get who thought it would be fun to walk on a conveyer belt against its moving direction. This is as much fun as a guiding an npc that walks half your speed. Why not just replace the conveyer belt by a longer path?
[*] There are already hackers in the game. To be fair, right now they are only speedhackers and that does not help on every level. However, two of the three final stages are basically a safe lose if you get one in your match. 
[/list]

I really hope they will improve the game in the future. I would gladly change my review to a positive one, but in this state its a game that I won't play for too long. There are so many frustrating things going on. And while some of them are my personal taste, other problems need to be fixed. 
I am also sceptical about how this game will do in the long run. Offering a casual game experience like this while also catering to the competitive crowd never really works out well imo.",False

"A fun game, specially with friends. But can't recommend it in its current state at all.

What even is the point of cheating in such a game ?",False
"I like the game and I have lots of fun playing it with friends, but I have to leave a negative review for now. Lately big issue has been hackers and servers are crashing pretty often. You'd think they would update the game more frequently considering how popular it is. Still no anti cheat, spectating feature is bad (especially since the names are removed and it's  a 4 digit number now), lack of levels etc. 

Also when it comes to crowns it sucks that you can't buy them with kudos, since most legendary skins require 5 crowns for each part. Grinding is not an option either because lack of levels make it boring after a while and also there is more and more cheaters each day. 
I'm looking forward to a big update that would make this game more fair and enjoyable. (I truly hope we don't need to wait till season 2) 

𝗨𝗣𝗗𝗔𝗧𝗘: We have anti cheat now which is really good. The additional obstacles in levels are ok. 
Bonus update: I'm still bad at the game - after 70 hours I only have 1 win :) 
Thank you for coming to my ted talk. 

So the slime that instant KOs fall guys when they fall into it appears to be the same slime as the ""slippery slime"", just in larger amounts. It makes no sense for it to be an instant KO due to a chemical property or poison quality the slime might have, because fall guys walk on the slippery slime all the time with no problems. Therefore it must be a knockout due to drowning, which also makes no sense. Even though as shown above fall guys do not have big lungs compared to their bodies, they should still survive a little bit before drowning. However it is an instant death. This is also interesting, because fall guys should in theory be able to swim quite well. Their clumsy nature on land seems to indicate that they are more efficient in another environment, and because they don't have wings or any other source of flight (that we currently know of) that other environment would seem to be liquid. The slime seen in Fall Guys seems to be a watery consistency as far as slime is concerned, so swimming shouldn't be difficult to them especially because they have been compared to aqueous animals such as manatees, penguins, and walruses. Therefore we can assume the fall guy can swim, and lack of the ability is not the cause of death. Another aspect comes once again from the game Slime Climb. In that game a fall guy is eliminated the second they touch the slime that is rising toward the top (or the obstacle course is sinking in the slime), so maybe it can be concluded that the slime is a sort of catching mechanism instead of one that kills. Perhaps landing in slime does not kill, it is just an indicator that a fall guy has failed. Alas, this too, is a flawed argument. The surviving fall guys do not see eliminated fall guys swimming below them, they just sink. Also we do not see a fall guy retrieval mechanism. Using the points above I have come to the conclusion that the elimination is solely for the purposes of the game and that fall guys can breath in slime and that after elimination they simply swim away from the arena.",False

The good thing is, there is basically less skill needed to win than in other battle royales. Everyone can win with a little bit of luck. Team matches sometimes feel a bit unfair but since it takes like 2 minutes and another 30 seconds to get into the next game, its not really that frustrating to lose.
After almost 10 hours i am not burned out of the game and really looking forward to play more. The ""battle pass"" is free and you can get new outfits by playing. There are some outfits which you can't buy in-game and just through real money. I don't know how they will continue to make money, since new mini games will be free and the battle pass also is free (right now).

3) There are a couple really bad maps like tail grab, where the first 75% of the round is basically meaningless because the amount of tails is only counted at the end.

I was really, really excited to play this. It's right up my alley and I was right, on the rare occasion that I could play it, it's great.

But I have never been able to play on my own. I just can't connect. I sit there on the populating screen for 10 minutes and get a can't find players error without fail. I always have to get dragged into matches via someones party, which means I can't play nearly as much as I want. IDK why this happened, the articles I read on it say its a glitch but that's not the worst part. 

Look, I know this game got way more popular than they thought it would but the amount of support I received about this issue was ""wait 48 hours and try again"". That is the ONLY help I got from them in 8 days. Sure they say ""if that doesn't work, give us your support code and we will help you"" but they haven't, there has been no acknowledgment it didn't work, no 'we're working on it' nothing.

"In Summary:
Fun in short bursts, but very repetitive and ultimately an exercise in frustration.

Pros:
This game is amazing, it's Takeshi's Castle while on acid-infused jelly-beans, with almost as many colours.
Games are simple, fun and fast to get into when you do ultimately fall, and currently well populated.
Watching people fail to tell the difference between a banana and a grape, or grasp the concept of a see-saw never gets old.
Slime, i miss those old Nickelodeon game shows, this game hits that nostalgia button (Legends of the Hidden Temple Theme for Season 2 and I might change this review on that alone...).

Cons:
No tutorial, no practice modes; go in and get wrecked mate. You are told the game mode and a key button... that's it.
You are at the mercy of a rather limited random game line-up; in team games assigned team-mates ranging from Lionel Messi to that kid that ate glue in pre-school i.e. those game modes are often heavily one-sided, good luck.
Inconsistent physics and latency make some games impossible to even participate.
Bugs and frustrations:
- Leaving a game is subject to a small window or only after the next game-mode start, a auto-option in settings for always leave on elimination please?
- Latency and hit registering; tail tag, egg and fall ball can be impossible; grabbing can take too long to register yet I can have things grabbed off me from a distance? also seem to sometimes just phase directly through a ball without registering.
- MC's in a paid game; you like that one cosmetic right? Haha, go grind and actually win 5 games or pay-up sucker.
- Get used to losing and have fun doing it, or else there's not much left for you here; get gud or get lucky.
- Other people; seriously? grabbing hold just to take you out with them, you know who you are ;) cheeky blighters...

Final word:
I'm your fall-guy for what you know yourself to be true: Yes, I am bad at this game. Yes, I am salty. Even so, it's primarily a couple flaws holding me back from recommending this game; from having more fun than frustration, at the time of writing this.

Fall Guys has been released over a month ago and still none of the main issues have been fixed. 

The game is full of cheaters because there is no real anti cheat integrated and no way to report cheaters either.

Also you will often randomly get kicked midgame cause the servers crash and you won't get any points then.
Players are still named ""Fall Guy"" followd by a random 4 digit number instead of their actual steam name, also no way to spectate only friends when you are qualified already or disqualified before. 

Content-wise there are 25 levels but they get boring quite fast. 
Season 2 is supposed to be released next month, but in the trailer we only saw like 5 new levels. I think  the game is gonna lose the majority of the player base in the long term if they keep taking this long for fixes/ updates and more content.

The servers could get a little look up to also.
And obviously, new game mods and workshop integration would make the game a lot greater, maybe a creative mode where the people can make they're own maps and put them up for others to enjoy.
If the game remains in this state I don't give it a long life imo, altrough it got a massive amount of interest from people both from steam and playstation. Also cross-platform would not be a bad idea at all for this game.

Mediatonic does seem to be willing to tackle this issue but does so in all the wrong ways, instead of using anti cheat software (which I know won't be to people's liking either.. but a necessary evil the way I see it) tries to tackle the hackers by removing Humble Bundle discounts and disabling Steam Family Share something I'm vehemently against because to me you're punishing the wrong people, plus the effectiveness seems debatable at best.

While I'm sure some hackers are actually playing to win and hoping to get away with some crowns there's also a big majority who just seems to hack to annoy others, they troll and try go grab people dragging them up or just slamming into them for doodoos and giggles.

It's such a shame really, the game hits all the right notes on accessibility, family friendliness, tons of customization options, fun sounds and fun games yet is plagued by these Menfants who insist on cheating in a game that really has no purpose to even cheat in.

Ultimately looking back on it, right now in its current state despite all the good things, I really don't recommend buying the game until this is sorted. It's stressful to play in a finale which you already know you're going to lose because some kiddo has an application running that makes them able to fly wherever they so desire.

Fall Guys > Fortnite,True
"Edit 06/08/2020: I've updated the bottom of the post with some extra info related to comments.

I played a bunch of the beta, so now that the full game is released I feel I can write my first review of the game.

Fall Guys is SO CLOSE to being really good, but there's just a few things in the game that need to be changed to let me get consistent enjoyment out of it.

The positives of the game is that it's goofy fun, and easy to jump into a game. Other people's reviews will cover the fun parts of the game, but I wanted to highlight the things that stop me from giving this game a positive review.

1) Team games need to get in the bin. They're the least fun part of Fall Guys, as you can get knocked out from a show even by playing really well. There's very little feedback from the game as to what is happening across the rest of the match. When you lose it wasn't down to your fault, and when you win it doesn't feel satisfying. There needs to be separate playlists for solo play and team play, and the team games need to be adjusted so that you'll be playing with the same team for the whole show and you can actually feel like you're contributing to a team effort. There would need to be ways to communicate with your team similar to rocket league, or by using the otherwise pointless emote system.

2) The costume colours need to get in the bin. It feels really scummy that not only do you need to wait for the store to refresh an item you're looking for (the store is ripped directly from fortnite) but you have to buy multiple costumes to have choices of colours. The costumes even change colours for team games, so there should definitely be a way for the player to customise the colour of the costumes they've unlocked. The player colours that you unlock end up feeling a bit worthless when wearing a costume has the possibility of completely obscuring it anyway. Why is it that the design decision was made for a player to either prioritise a player skin/colour or a costume? It's really peculiar and only seems to be used to pad out the amount of content in the store.

3) Lack of content. I read somewhere that there are 25 different maps at launch, with some maps sharing the same game mode. The most fun parts of the game are the obstacle courses, and there reaaaaaally needs to be more, preferably with the option of a playlist of only obstacle courses. The maps are all made from the same building blocks, so it shouldn't be too difficult to have a bunch more of them in the game. Considering the game isn't free to play, and this isn't early access, I hope that the roster of maps will be updated very soon and not at the end of season 1 which is going to go on for 60 days...

4) Some of the game modes are really not that fun at all. It's usually the team ones, but especially game modes like the Jinxed one. In Jinxed, two teams are pitted against each other and you have to grab players to infect them. Last team with an uninfected player wins. No matter how the game is played it pretty much always comes down to 1 player left on each team, and you'll likely have very little involvement with how the match ends up finishing. I'm sure on paper team games looked like fun, but seeing as this game is ""heavily inspired"" by Takeshi's Castle, it's worth looking at why they didn't really do team games. I hope that now the game is out, feedback from players will help shape what game modes get further development and which game modes get more maps.

5) £50/$60 currency purchase in the store. I mean, what more needs to be said about that. The game isn't free so you can't just carbon copy the store from fortnite, which is a free to play game. I don't like paying for and playing a game that essentially tells me I'm wasting my time earning currency by actually playing it, when I could instead make a purchase of 100K coins that would take me dozens of hours to grind out. I'm honestly okay with paying £4/$5 for 3 exclusive skins as DLC, as is currently on offer, but the in-game store purchases are just really not nice for the players.

This game is so close to being really, really good, and I hope that the developer's response to community feedback will shape the game and let me change this review to a positive one in the future.

-----------------------------------------------
06/08/2020
- All maps were available in the beta.
- The store is similar to Fortnite's in that content is time exclusive, meaning a player has to spend their currency or feel like they may miss out. There is no way to guarantee you're going to be able to unlock a specific item you may want, unless it is one of the DLC items.
- The number of games at launch won't be enough to sustain certain players, and £15 isn't an unsubstantial amount of money. Further, the size of the game at launch makes me worried that additional maps will be added in a conservative way, as the game is already quite large with only the maps at launch. It also seems that the possibility of community-made content would be hampered by large map sizes.
- This last point is a personal perspective, so I understand that people may not agree with it, and that's okay. But to me, by definition this isn't an indie game as Devolver Digital is the publisher for it. I know that people have different definitions of what constitutes an indie game, so it's not a point that I'm dead set on defending. It comes down to personal perspective.

Overall, I've been enjoying the game, especially with friends (even though playing with friends doesn't get you any benefits and you're guaranteeing not everyone can win!). But this review isn't written for me, it's written for people who have to decide whether they can afford to spend £15 on something that may or may not be worth what money they have.",False

"You know it hurts me but I can't recommend it right now for $20

It's fun. It's wacky, and with a group of friends it would probably be a down right good time.

The problem is the team minigames. For a game with only one winner they sure like to make you work together a lot. The best games are the obstacle courses done solo. Don't make me work with people I'm trying to beat, especially when I can't really communicate with them. It just makes it feel like ""did I get RNGed on to the team that's going to win?""

This game made me more patient, despise hugs, induced trust issues and hate yellow color. Despite all of it, I solemnly swear this is the best game I have played in 2020.

[b]Update 1 (24 Sep 2020)[/b] : The new update/patch on 15th Sep that includes EAC, breaks the Linux compatibility via Proton. So unless, there is no native build pushed by Mediatonic, the game will be borked for Linux users.
Game is still fun, but the servers are TRASH. If they don't fix the server/matchmaking/desync issues, you'll watch this game dead right after Season 2.

On a serious note..

Watch gameplay before you buy it, there is an insanely little amount of levels for the 20$ asking price and the current server issues/bugs going on. No anti-cheat was put into the game at launch and this shows pretty heavily.

The game itself isn't bad, but sometimes it feels like the devs have no idea what they're doing. Playing really is a blast but the experience server wise and the communication from the devs on multiple occasions has felt quite the opposite.",True

"[h1] Fall Guys,the game that could [/h1]

Fall guys is a simple yet impressively hard to master game in some ways,through the course of playing it you will learn ""secret"" starts for almost every single map that will increase the chances of winning or coming first on a map,unless you get grabbed by some motherfucker from 1 mile away because of ping delay.

The maps are well done,simple,elegant,and instantly recognizable,such are the character designs,its a great looking game that can go for every age group,which makes this game an insane money maker and a insanely good investment for everyone.

This game could honestly be incredible,and in some ways it is,the feeling you get when you win a crown for the first time is unparalleled,but so is the time when you lose to a hacker that can fly.

[h1] Why i think Fall Guys is trash [/h1]

From its release we were promised better Anti Cheat systems,yet still to this day i see a hacker in at least every 5th game,and at most it can get too be in every single fucking game i play,these hackers are not only getting outfits that cost 10 crowns,some of them are even LEVEL FUCKING 40,i have 60 hours in this game,and i myself am not fucking lvl 40.

The constant bugs on some maps that cause you to lose because they can't fix them for a month straight,like getting stuck on Block Party,or maybe even Falling through the fucking tiles in HEX-A-GONE,so many unpolished mechanics that are left untouched to this day.So many promises with nothing actually being done,they are riding the money train and doing nothing with that money,this game deserves to die because of the lack of love for their community.

Also this is a minor nitpick compared to those 2 above,but there is this blur when you play on 144hz that kind of makes it unplayable,and yes that has and still will not be fixed because they don't fucking care.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk,
Sincerely Cerber",False
"Here are the issues: 

1.You're going to repeat A LOT of levels. There are not many levels in this game and the game gets very repetitive. It's going to strongly depend on how much fun you like playing the game, when it comes to how quickly you will get bored. 

2.Hardly any cosmetics. In this game, prepare to look EXACTLY like every other player online. Even after playing for several hours, I still don't have a way to make myself stand out from other players. Even the selection of cosmetics in the ""store"" are lacking. VERY disappointing. 

3. Microtransaction. Yup, this game has microtransactions. And on top of that, it costs 20€ for some “shiti” skins.
4. Gameplay is TERRIBLE. You jump, land and start flopping around on the ground. Even if you don't touch anything.... you can jump, land on flat surface with nobody around and start ragdolling. 

5. The game can be glitchy/laggy. There have been moments (and I even recorded these moments to make sure I was losing my mind) where I would beat someone else at something (like jumping through a hoop before them) but the game registered them beating me at it first. 

6. To many cheater for a game like this, the devs are to lazy to solve this.

Honestly, this game deserves around a 5/10, maybe 6/10. 

Eventually the hype it will disappear and the game will slowly die because the devs he is more interested on Twitter who donates most 🧀 to receive a skin in the game.",True

"Ammended review. Game is fun when everything works right, but theres frequent lag and disconnects from games. The servers are techinically better in that they are usually working now though. Also been running into hackers fairly frequently. 

Still wouldn't recommend, too often I DC in or before the last round, or I get queued with someone that can jump straight to the finish line when the match starts. Still more frustrating than fun currently.",False
"Fun when you first play it but then kinda becomes the same thing over and over, taking the same paths and the same maps, i understand that its just released but im hoping its not the same selection of maps for the entirety of season one which is 2 months

Some of the maps, like the ones where you just run and avoid obstacles are fun, the fake door and the fake floor maps are just down to rng which I dont really like, especially the door one, its pot luck if you get to qualify because of 40 or so people trying to squeeze through the last door.

There should be a separate playlist for [url=https://imgur.com/a/nuYQ9IM] team games [/url] in the future, its a bit annoying when you play really well and you dont qualify because you lost by one point, especially if its the last round >:(

However I do like that they give you a free battlepass with skins and currency (premium and non premium) and also that you gain non premium currency kinda quickly if you do well.

I hope mediatonic won't abandon this game after a few seasons, its got promise to be a good game in the long run.",False

My Initial Thoughts:
This game is bags of fun and looks great in VR with VorpX, I even think I had a bit of an advantage over the other players becuase I could judge the distance and jumps better than what you can on a flat screen. But sadly that didn't help me win any games.

I really wish developers like this could see the potential of their game in VR.

",True
"It isn't a bad game, but I don't feel like it knows what it wants to be.  It is silly chaotic fun, so can't really be considered competitive, which makes it feel like a party game you'd play on the couch with friends.  But it's an online battle royale game.

I find anything to do with the 'grab' button frustrating.  To grab an edge, or an opponent's tail, or anything else is not fun, or silly, or challenging, its annoying and frustrating.  It is doubly frustrating when you are chasing down someone who is the same speed as you.  You might get one chance when they screw up... then the button does nothing even though you seem to be close enough, aimed right, and so on. 

In the spirit of the above complaint.  There is lag of some kind, which means people who look like they are distant from you can grab your tail.  It makes trying to evade people pointless, since you aren't actually seeing where they (or an egg, or anything else) actually is.

The team games are just... bad.  They aren't the chaotic fun of the other games, they are frustrating as you feel like you have no meaningful impact on the results most of the time.  That's assuming the teams are even, the player count is often not divisible by the number of teams so one or more teams has an inherent advantage.  They may as well just roll a die to see who proceeds.  

Too add to my team game complaint.  I don't mind losing due to luck.  I don't mind losing due to me playing poorly.  But I don't want to feel like my playing poorly is ruining other people's games who are playing better, and I don't want to feel like nothing I do mitigates bad luck.

The microtransactions make it feel like a freemium mobile game... that I paid $20 for.  I get that they need some method to support things long term, but how they've gone about it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

There are far too many blatant cheaters who could have been caught by the most rudimentary anti-cheat.  I'm not even talking about people who are subtly cheating, I imagine they could be hard to catch, but people who are going at 2x (or even 10x) speed.  People who can fly.  People who have perfect knowledge of doors/tiles/etc.  I imagine they could have included simple checks for plenty of these (such as checking if a level was completed in a literally impossible time, or if they reached a point from the start line before obstacles in an impossible time), instead I saw blatant cheaters in numerous games in the few hours I played.  So I either play, and waste however long knowing I won't win, or quit, and waste time on queueing/loading and hope the next game doesn't also have a cheater.

All of that said... the core of the game is amusing.  I want to like it, but I just find it far too frustrating to keep playing due to wonky mechanics, lack of anti-cheat, and forced team games.  It's amusing to watch a ravenous horde of zombies (sorry, fall guys) trying to get through a door.  It's amusing to be launched into the stratosphere because I misjudged a propeller.

But the longer you play the less fun you have because most of the games are team play games and you will lose some of them regardless of how good you do. I think that is the wrong way to go for a ""Last man Standing"" game. I'd atleast let people choose if they want to participate in team games or not. Also the team games cover for over 50% of the gameplay which overtime drains you and makes you just kinda stop having fun",False
"Fun to start with, but loses its shimmer very quickly as it gets old.

Enjoyed it to some degree, however the Team games are what lets this game down.
Often loses team games due to other teammates sabotaging the team, whether on purpose or not is unknown. Most likely due to many younger players.

Make your own mind up whether you want this game or not as it can be fun. but the lack of true co-op definitely hinders this title.

My down vote is purely based on being an older player. This game is less skill and more run around like a headless chicken.

"The game is just pure joy. Wipeout battle royale is a very good spin on the BR genre, allowing for quick, fun rounds alone or, even better, with friends. Obstacle races are super fun and varied. The art is cute and the game is good for anyone who wants to experience it.

Now onto the cons: Some maps are widely disliked by the community:
Memory game map, which is kinda boring because it needs no skill other than ""follow the mass"".
All tail tag maps, because they last 1 and a half minutes, and only the last few seconds even count for anything, plus also showing the desync problems the servers have currently.
Team games as a whole: widely disliked because it gets really frustrating due to qualifying being up to randoms instead of yourself. Good thing is, if you're in a party, all of you will get thrown in the same team, so you can sync up over voice chat. (Dirty little secret: Rock N Roll is my favourite map, even though it's a team game)

Final score: 8.5/10. I know I may have gone deeper into the negatives than the positives, but the fun in all the maps I didn't mention vastly overcome the few bad maps there are. I'm hopeful devs will keep polishing the game and hopefully ride the wave they've build in these first few days.",True

The developers lies about cheaters being dealt with need to stop and they need to actually come out with the truth that they have no idea of what they are doing and that they are hopefully planing on fixing it. (if they really are) Becuse the system they have to date doesn't work and they are ignoring that fact. My guess is that the developers is gonna take their winnings and live happy ignoring the rest of these issues. The fact that they dont even have a report system is proof enough that they dont care, and dont tell me there is no need for a report system becuse it being dealt with, becuse we both know... it isent.

"Shit game fr,
No anti cheat, literally every single game i played the last 3 weeks had a hacker in the lobby, they don't even care, they even said to player to ""stop reporting hackers and making videos showing hackers in your game"".

"My list of pros and cons are appended

Pros
- Grouping people from the same lobby together for team games
- Games that focus on different aspect of games i.e. motor skills, memory, teamwork
- Able to see the location of your teammates during the games as indicated by the red arrow above (can be improved by assigning different color arrow for different players)
- Adding more games when compared to the beta version in both normal stages and final stages

Cons 
- Lack of actions during lobby. There are places for improvements. Additional actions such as interaction between teammates or customizing character could be done during the ""falling"" phase
- Hard to identify the location of teammates from the same lobby during the elimination screen. The red arrow that was used in the games could be placed on the screen to help identify teammates
- Spectator mode focuses on random people when one completed stage or eliminated. The spectator mode should have priority that focus on the teammates from lobby first before focusing on others.
- Lack of 2-party pack or 4-party pack would mean lesser interest in the game.
- Games are still limited numbers but understandable as the game is just released
- Max lobby size is 4. Personally, when playing with streamer, they would prefer to have their a bigger size lobby to play with their viewer. Hopefully, there are plans to increase the team lobby size.
- Lack of smaller private size games. Hopefully, there are plans to implement this.

After all is said, there are potential for improvements and I would recommend the game. However, due to the price of the game, i would recommend to get only if
- the game is on sale
- the game comes in party pack
- friends to play with
- money and time to spend",True

"Fall Guys is a lot of fun but after playing the game for 7 hours the minigames are starting to get old.
I will play this more for sure but if the devs want to keep this game interesting they have to put in some new minigames in the coming seasons. But all in all Fall Guys is a really fun game. When you play with your friends, it's even more fun.

I made a full video-review on my YouTube-Channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGn_zbE7wME
",True
"A suuuper fun game but

Out of 10 games, at 7-8 there are cheaters and I'm not kidding.
Of 10 games, in 4-5 the server kicks me due to connection problems. (I have 600mb so it's not a problem with my internet)
Maybe I'm playing a game in which there is no cheaters (yey!) and when I reach the final he kicks me through the server or crashes me.

The minigames are super fun, and I understand the success of the video game but in the state it is in right now I feel very frustrating.

Sorry if my English is shit.",False
"For me player sync is the only issue. I don't even care about speedhackers.
1. Desyncs: moving objects physics is lagging. Someone run near you and after half sec delay you pushed somewhere because server decided to do so. In tag games you can touch player and server did not register that, but you get tagged with 3-body-length-far grabs.
2. Camera: If I play on mouse+keyboard than I must have full control of it, there must be no mouse acceleration and smoothing, no angle change if my camera touch wall collision (this is a real issue on ""jump through ring"" map).
3. Options: Lack of it. Again, no mouse configuration, can use only standard bindings on it. If you want to switch LMB with RMB, change windows setting to left-handed.

Balancing problems that I feel myself and notice watching streams is a ""always blame blue/orange"" in a 3-team-games. Why don't randomize team colors on client side to avoid that?

Another thing is ""connection problem"" pop-up. You have no problems and close to victory? Don't worry, we will create problems for you!
You get this connection error pop-up, but you can see that usually game continues and small part of players still play game and most of unlucky players froze on place. Why you force me to quit game when everything is ok? If I see that all is gone and nothing works, I can myself press esc->quit, thanks.

If games like this for you is something more than just a time killer and you have a competitive spirit I can only advise is to wait for discount/fixes.",False
"I think this game can be incredibly fun. What isn't fun is hackers. Imagine being such a lowlife degenerate that you'd rather hack and get such soulless wins in a game with no ELO system that's meant to be an entirely relaxed and HEAVILY RNG based experience. 

Aside from that, this game was made to drop in with some friends and have some fun, till you end up in a few of the worst Free For All experiences ever introduced to online gaming.

Certain games are downright pointless to participate in. And I'm saying this as someone who's succeeded at them all at one point or another, and earned some wins.

If future game modes are introduced over time that are consistently less reliant on completely random factors, and hackers are incapable of entering and ruining the experience, this game can definitely be easily recommended in future. But for now, I'd rather not.",False

Also both good and bad that their launch day was a success and a disaster.

"This game saved my life.

I am 20.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",True

"Amazing game that takes inspiration from Takeshi's Castle and a couple other sources. The characters and cosmetics are very cute, and the controls are simple as well.  Gameplay is vibrant and very fun.

But due to the limited number of levels at launch and if you're playing solo, it's going to get repetitive after a few hours. But that's not an issue as long as the devs keep adding new content or stages over time. Devs also mentioned crossplay between PS4 and PC is coming soon so that's gonna help with long-term player population. 

Get it if you want a fun little game that's pretty unique and fun to play with friends/solo. Or else wait for sale.",True
"not gonna recommend they dont ban hackers

"What i dislike about fall guys is the grabbing feature. i understand it for games like tail tag, but games where it isnt necessary it shouldnt be included. also, speaking of tail tag, it is the worst mini game. The way it should go is you get a point for every second that you have the tail, so that you dont have the tail the entire game but then get it snatched at the end.",True
"Fun but frustrating at times!

Just uninstalled a week after the game's release. Right now as the current games state, it is solid and smooth.. Even though it's locked at 60FPS, but the servers are shocking. LOTS of connection issue's, disconnects and players with terrible Internet glitching at times grabbing your tail when on your screen, they are miles away... Right now I would say avoid and wait for them to fix the servers before the game. Once they do, it's enjoyable and worth the time to play.

Graphics: The graphics are covert bright and vibrant, with some cool little smoke effects but nothing amazing or visually impressive, it’s a unique looking art style but as I write this review, it’s locked to 60fps and it’s noticeable when planning around and it’s a little frustrating with such a low FPS on a high refresh rate monitor. 

Audio: The music is alright and cute but I turned it down. The little jelly bean fall guys make amusing sounds and there some interesting emote sounds, otherwise no really map sounds like swishing or swatting from fans or machine. It’s a pretty much soundless experience feeling I get and can easily be played with no sound and still enjoy. The main audio is music and the character hopping sounds. 

Controls: Super easy controls to use and highly recommended to use a controller. Key customising is decent and literally only need the movement keys with jump and grab. That’s it, the rest are not needed. 

Gameplay and everything else: So before I explain, my main massive frustration is the player base and grabbing. So many times you’ll start and a player will just grab you... why? Just because you’ve given up, does not mean I have so get a grip you troll. This happens a lot! No need for grabbing and they do! I wish there was a report trolling players button because this game has its fair share!

It’s basically a soft core battle royale made for kids but massively enjoyable for all ages. It’s actually the first battle royale my wife likes and enjoyable to play together. Right now, it’s easy getting games but unsure for how long. 

There is no pay to win and it’s all cosmetic based which is awesome and the store is random for each player with different items showing for all, kinda okay with this method. 

Lots of players spawn and run through Takeshi’s castle style game modes but often I’ve found the same game or maps seem to pop up and it does feel boring with that and needs a lot more random because I’ve played 5 matches and had the same maps on each one, then one random different one... this needs correcting to stop drying out.  
I would like to see some sort of glowing, sparkle, shining effect skins in the future but happy to play this game with friends. 

Would I recommend this game? Yes, it’s extremely cheap and offers a different unique take on the genre and worth it’s time. Devolver make some of the most solid releases to date.",True
"This game is an absolute gem. Sure it had it's initial server issues but what game doesn't nowadays and to review negatively because of that is just silly.

"tl;dr. It's not a bad concept but currently it's lacking a lot of replay value. Wait until they add more maps/game modes.


This game got recommended to me as a takeshi's castle game of some sorts. If you haven't seen the show then stop reading this and watch it. The gameplay is straight up takeshi's castle. It's great fun trying to reach the finish line while avoiding obstacles. There is only one huge problem. After you reach the 1-hour mark or so, it starts to get repetitive. Everything after that feels like a copy of itself. At this point you have already seen every map, gamemode and everything else as well. You could just say that maybe this type of game isn't for everyone and I can surely agree to that. Not if a game runs out of content after one hour or less. Yes you could try to achieve the epic victory royale but for what? You don't get anything out of it, maybe a 10 second dopamine rush. Yes, there is no other reward besides currency for skins. The artstyle is generic but cute, soundtrack is nothing special and of course it has a skin shop. This game needs seriously a heavy content update, because right now it's not even close of being worth its current price tag.",False

"I bought this game because it worked great in Steam Play for Linux.  Unfortunately the devs have later decided to add an anti-cheat that breaks this support, and since it was over 2 weeks ago when I bought the game, I am no longer eligible for a refund for a game that is now impossible for me to play.  Don't buy this game.",False
"Honestly, the game is amazing. 
It is some of the most fun I've had playing with my friends in a VERY long time. 
This negativity, isn't because I can never win, because that simply isn't the case. But the servers in this game, as of right now, are horrendous. 
First problem is the game runs client side, not server side which puts players with good ping at a distinct disadvantage (look at DbD before dedicated servers were launched). This allows for players to for example, grab you or your tail if you're playing tail tag from many characters away, or run on platforms that are already gone in hex-a-gone, and in worst case scenarios, grab a crown before you do, even though on your screen, they aren't even touching the crown. 
That, is a minor negative, and is easily fixed. 
The BIG problem with this game as of right now (and no, I don't want to hear about how it launched less than 2 weeks ago, they made over 50M in sales, and to have servers THIS unstable is a sin.) are, like you read in the previous; terrible. 
Constant random disconnects-inability to join matches due to the server being 'full'-randomly getting backed out of games while your friends join and continue to play-and finally no name tags. The names have been down for over a week.

With all that being said, if you can stand that, the game is amazing. And they will be fixing the servers (hopefully.. as they've not spoken on a majority of the points above) eventually. 
So once that happens, I will change my recommendation.",False

"Fall guys are a fun and colorful game that features a lot of yellow humor, which is a bittersweet experience. It is sweet when you play as it is fun and cute, but it is bitter when you don't win that precious crown! Without friends, it can get repetitive fast and might lack a general-purpose since playing with friends makes it far more interactive and entertaining. That being said, it is still a fantastic game to enjoy solo! I won 4 times so far, and it makes my heart skip every time I classified for a final! 

I get the goosebumps running the obstacles as other players fall to their demise or struggle between the multitude to be able to get ahead of the competition. I feel energetic and pleasant when I classified, but more than anything, a sense of relief hehe... If you want to have fun with friends, do get it! It is a new sensation! If you're going to play solo, go ahead but ask yourself if you would be interested in redoing the same by yourself. I heard the devs might add new stages and features in due time, so look forward to that!

The only complaint about this title is the team games and some of the final rounds. I think there should be an option for team games as they are, for the most part, decided by luck as you can do a lot, but team games are won by teams, not individuals in most cases. As for last round, I would like to see more skill-based minigames such as hexagonia rather than the race or grab the tail, but this is simply my take on it! So are you ready to take the fall, my guy?

"This game reminds me of Takeshi's Castle or Wipeout reality shows, but instead of watching those shows now you can be one of the contestants! Battle among 59 other players in a variety of game modes, where only 3 quarters of the contestants will move on to the next round until only 1 winner remains.

The game modes are many, among them you have the race where you will navigate an obstacle course, survival where you try to stay alive for example standing on a moving platform (until enough people are eliminated), team where you will be assigned team mates and win or lose together by completing objective, and finally the Final mode which the winner takes it all. 

This is a fun party game with adorable cartoonish design and cheerful soundtrack that will definitely put a smile on your face. Plus, you can buy or unlock cosmetics in game to decorate your character. It is very easy to play and there is no option to create a server, you will just get assign into a game randomly.

"If you’ve not heard of Fall Guys already, you should probably crawl out from under your rock more often! Since its release earlier this month, Fall Guys has taken the world by storm, and rightly so! They’re saying Fall Guys is a battle royale, but I strongly disagree. While it was a great marketing strategy to get the attention of Fortnite fans, the only real similarity to a battle royale is that there’s only one winner. Fall Guys is a contest made up of several different rounds, similar to the likes of Takeshi’s Castle, Wipeout, and It’s a Knockout, but in a very colourful world, where all the contestants resemble beans, and they’re generally dressed in a whole variety of different costumes!

I initially played around 15 hours of the technical beta, thanks to The Partisan Spy giving me a beta key during his stream. I even managed to win… Once. After the beta ended, I went straight on to pre-purchase the Collector’s Edition, that’s just how much I enjoyed it, and shortly after release, I bought another copy for my girlfriend. She’s not a gamer, but I do try getting her playing games every now and then. She’s probably spent more time in Fall Guys then every other game she’s tried, combined! She loves it! We played many hours together with another friend, and every time has been a great laugh!

The first week or so involved a lot of disconnections and server downtime, but I honestly wasn’t too bothered about it. I’ve been around for a lot of MMO releases, and the Fall Guys release was much smoother than the majority of them. Mediatonic have been working hard to provide a more stable gaming experience, and it’s definitely been noticeable! Stability has improved massively, and now I have very few connection issues!

So, the game… You’re one of 60 beans/contestants in an episode of Fall Guys, where you’ll be racing, jumping, diving, dodging, grabbing, and pushing your way through a mix of races, survival, and team rounds to reach the final, where you’ll ultimately dive at the crown instead of grabbing it! No? Just me? Okay then… There are currently four different final rounds; Fall Mountain, Jump Showdown, Hexagone, and Royale Fumble, each one being completely different from the other and providing totally different challenges! This is often where the fun and silly game becomes a battle to the death, complete with shouting, screaming, and swearing! Please, Mediatonic, never introduce voice chat!

The further you make it through an episode/game, and the better you perform in each round, the more XP and kudos you get. If you manage to win an episode, you get drastically more! The more XP you get, the further you progress through the season levels, and the more awesome cosmetics, crowns, and kudos you unlock! Crowns and Kudos are the currency in Fall Guys. Crowns can only be acquired from winning episodes and at certain season levels, but Kudos is gained from all rounds, various season levels, and can be purchased from the in game shop. I’d like to point out that buying Kudos is definitely not a requirement, and I’ve not even been tempted to spend real money on the game. The seasons have 40 levels to them, and to be quite honest, reaching the end is pretty achievable, even for people with lives. I mention this simply because whenever I’ve played other games with seasons, I’ve never even come close to completing them!

Cosmetics are a huge part of Fall Guys, and there are loads of them! There’s also endless potential for even more costumes and collaborations with other games and companies! You can customise the colour, skin pattern, face, upper, and lower body, as well as your victory emotes and victory poses, should you ever win an episode. As eluded to previously, you can unlock cosmetics through season progression, and via the in game shop using your Kudos and Crowns. Items in the shop rotate on a regular basis, so you don’t need to wait long before finding something that really clicks with you!

The game is great fun playing solo, but I recommend playing with friends even more! It’s hilariously fun! You can have up to four beans in a party, and while it doesn’t really change a great deal about the game, when it comes to team rounds, you’ll be on the same team. Of course, there’s nothing stopping you from ganging up on other beans in races or survival rounds either.

As with most online multiplayer games, it does suffer from the occasional hacker. From what I’ve seen in game and in videos, these tend to be very obvious. You might see a bean flying into the sky, or shoot ahead with insane speed. These are simply sad little beans, longing for more bean hugs. I’ve been pretty lucky as I’ve only come across a small number of hackers so far, but one of the most satisfying things in Fall Guys is seeing a hacker lose! There’s even been team games where beans sabotage their own team just to eliminate the hacker! Not any that I’ve been in, but I’ve seen videos! It’s pretty awesome!

There are a few things I’m hoping will come to Fall Guys at some point in the near future. One of them is local/split-screen parties. I get a similar kind of joy from playing Fall Guys as I did from playing Gang Beasts, and I know split-screen would be a complete hit for the game! I’d also like to be able to play with more friends. It would be the perfect game for large groups of friends playing together! This would be perfect for streamers! Image being able to stream with 10, 30, maybe even 59 followers or subscribers? Now whether this be through some form of server creation, or a party of parties, I wouldn’t really mind. I’d just love to be able to play with more than three friends!

After more than 45 hours of Fall Guys (there’ll be plenty more too), I think it’s safe to say I absolutely love it! That’s probably not a huge surprise, considering millions of people around the world have the same opinion, but it’s loved for a good reason! This game should have been thought up long before now, but I’m just happy to have it now! After having just seen what’s on the way for season two, I’m pretty hyped, and I’m seriously looking forward to the new costumes and rounds! If you haven’t played Fall Guys yet, you’re really missing out!

"I really want to give this game a positive review but damn are the devs not listening at all. Hear me out :

-[b] BETA AND SERVERS [/b] : I participated in the beta test kinda early which were roughly an hour of playtest and sometimes we couldn't connect to servers until 40 minutes have passed. I told them multiple times to be prepared for the launching date rush and nobody listened (I even got some people telling me that I should be glad to play an early version of the game). Launch day comes : Servers are kinda bad but it's ok and then comes the weekend where we had 40+ hours of downtime, what did we get ? A cactus, yay.

-[b] STEAM NAMES [/b] : It's been a MONTH since the Steam names got changed to Fall Guy#XXXX because of people doing HTML injection to mess with their own Steam names. We still have no ETA for when we are going to get our Steam names back.

-[b] CHEATING [/b] : Oh god this one. First, launching such a popular and hyped game without anti cheat ? I don't get it but okay. So if you followed you can see everybody is named Fall Guy #XXXX, devs have put a ""report cheaters"" channel on their Discord but every Fall Guy number you put here could be 1000 different account so yeah that didn't work out. Then we were told that we need to stop reporting cheaters because it could encourage other people to do so, again a weird move, but okay. And then, we got told to not worry because cheaters were automatically detected and banned after the end of a game but we keep seeing cheaters with 10 crowns skins, who would really waste a 10 win account by cheating once ? Their anti cheat detection just doesn't work but look we got a witty twitter account, season 2 sneak peek and a big yeetus hammer haha.

Sorry if the review seem full of hate, I truly love the game (just got my 20th win, I'm at roughly 30 hours of play time) and I really want it to succeed. I will erase everything and put a positive review when Mediationic will prove that they know what they're doing and implement correct anti cheat systems.",False

[b]The main selling point of the Fall Guys release is - get this - you get to play Fall Guys whenever and for as long as you want. Coming from the beta of hour-long play sessions, that was all I needed.[/b]

[b]Unfortunately, its popularity has rendered that point to be so often moot (for the moment).[/b] Servers are up and down like the game's infamous seesaws. They're trying, though, they're really trying. I watch the Discord and the Server Owl (https://twitter.com/FallGuysOwl) to grab every moment I still can.

[b]This is largely an unnecessary review.[/b] Like Rocket League, this game is a phenomenon. With future seasons to come, it's likely going to be a multiplayer institution. All I can do here is point out why that's the case and then get out of its way.

[b]Fall Guys is not a complex game.[/b] It's one of the most accessible battle royale-esque games ever released, yet with just enough of a skill ceiling to keep things interesting. Its aesthetic and music resonate so much that Mediatronic must have inadvertently discovered a new reward pathway in the brain. It's like injecting pure rainbows. 

Surprisingly, despite its Saturday night gameshow appearance, it really doesn't lean much into this. A couple of hovering cameras are tossed around the levels and the beanies of whom don't qualify fall out of Hollywood Squares. Some extra stylistic embellishments like a jelly audience might help. I know they're at home because of the pandemic, but in that case the competitors are setting an incredibly bad social distancing example. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2191583057

In place of the traditional shooting fare, Fall Guys pares down the initial 60 jellybean peeps to one victor with minigames. Unlike most party games, whilst these still have great variation in premise, they never meander into different control schemes or quick time events. They all stick to a very solid foundation of platforming - jumping, diving and grabbing. As can be expected, there are the ones for which you jump for joy, those you're indifferent about and those you you wish would be removed from rotation forever.

[b]I think Fall Guys is at its best in its race and survival rounds.[/b] The various race rounds test your platforming mettle superbly. Door Dash and Tip Toe inject some heavy risk-reward tactics by requiring some to have the gumption to pave the way and risk hitting a wall or fall, yet hang too far back and you too might not finish in time. Other races are full of shortcuts and obstacles to perfect your approach to. The seesaw, frustrating as it can be,  perfectly embodies how Fall Guys is a platformer about navigating your competitors as well as the obstacles before you. The mass of jellies before you weigh down the seesaws precariously. Tight areas create desperate scrums of mashed together beans diving and launching every which way. You need to develop a predictive instinct for negotiating the random chaos. 

There are technically only three survival rounds, Block Party, Roll Out, and Jump Club, but they really stand out. I'd also count Hex-A-Gone, one of the final rounds, as one too. Like the races, they take advantage of the inherent chaos so incredibly well whilst placing the emphasis on careful, precise movement. The tactics of Hex-A-Gone make it my favourite round by far. Layers of hexagonal platforms disappear under your feet - be the last man standing. People quickly worked out that you can jump from platform to platform to slow your clearing to a crawl, but running like a madman to remove breathing room for others is also effective. You can remain at a higher tier for half the match, but meanwhile others might have completely cleared many of the tiers below and put you at a disadvantage. You therefore have to carefully plan your descent as well. Being a final round, it's the one for which a win feels truly earned.

[b]In terms of its competitive dimension and wins feeling 'earned,' I'd advise you don't overly worry with this one.[/b] It's often undermined by the sheer entropy involved. Getting better at Fall Guys is can only really be about tending towards performing better in each kind of round. There are too many factors at play, whether it's getting lucky with the timing of obstacles or having no Fall chums smacking you off your bean stalks. Further undermining all this is the team games. They're a clever addition. They also channel that need in the races to temporarily work collaboratively to overcome an obstacle. Get laboured with a particularly bad team, though? It's all over. Some aspects of these round types are just frustrating too. Right trigger being used for both picking up eggs and grabbing guys makes for chaos atop chaos in Egg Scramble. Not in a good way. I'm no great fan of the physics of the balls either. Whether it's Rock ‘N’ Roll, Fall Ball or Hoarders, the balls just feel cumbersome to move. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2191583150

My absolute least favourite round is the only logic type - Perfect Match. It's a memory game that tasks you with being on the right fruit tile when the time elapses. Although I like the social dynamic of some players betting on others knowing the correct tile when they haven't a clue, it's really too easy and feels out of place. Only the last stage of it is really tough enough to eliminate anyone (and it rarely does). 

[b]If Fall Guys falls down in any area, they it's in how quickly you've seen everything it offers.[/b] It's a compulsive, but quickly repetitive game to play. 'Now, Alphy, that applies to every Royale game ever, surely?', you might say. Sure, but I'd argue that Fall Guys with its small-scale, mini game structure has a much more limited 'possibility space' compared to all those admittedly tiresome shooters it fights shy of. Despite the chaos of the scrums, many rounds really do play out much the same. The customisation that relies on you actually winning games to unlock outfits is a great incentive to keep on going and aim high. It helps to prevent the microtransaction element from being too disagreeable too. Fall Guys has plenty of variation in types of round, but it's symptomatic of its design that even this doesn't feel enough. I can't wait for new seasons, but it's going to a much slower process than I'd like, I suspect.

[b]A quick word on where I fall on grabbing competitors.[/b] I'm a sensitive enough guy. I even wrote an essay on how the social capital of multiplayer is worth sacrificing for vulnerable players to avoid player toxicity. But on this? I'm all for it. Shove each other to your hearts content. This is a competition for dominance goddammit. Know that if you're thrown off a tile in the memory round, it's likely my doing. I have a Hotline Miami costume to unlock. Those players who wait to wrestle with you at the finish line? Consider them one final obstacle. It's nothing a good dive can't solve. That said, my girlfriend was traumatised by some tall glasses of trouble. Perhaps mine is not a victimless crime?

[b]And oh how I wish there was crossplay.[/b] I'm about to buy a month of PS Plus just so I can play this with a friend. My blood boileth over. Not really, but there are a few bubbles in there.

[b]Review concludes in the comments...[/b]",True
"Fall Guys is a multiplayer party game that pits you and up to 3 friends against about 50 other people (max lobby size is 60 but the lobbies rarely seem to get that full). You play through a number of different minigames, trying to make it to number one. The number of players gradually decreases, and last player standing/first player finished at the end of the game is crowned the winner.

The modes that are selected for play are based on the number of people still in the game. In general, I feel like most of the games are pretty fun and well-balanced. There are a couple of modes that feel drier (Perfect Match) or more frustrating (Fall Ball), but even those aren't terrible. 

Fall Guys is great to play with friends. It's also fun to play on your own, but having a few friends around to cheer you on or mess with you adds to the excitement. However, the maximum party size is 4, which feels a little small.

The art style of this game is really cute, like an adorable version of Wipeout. I really like the way the cosmetic system works too. Most of the items can be unlocked just by playing, either for free by playing and gaining in-game currency or by purchasing either exclusive DLC packs or by buying extra in-game currency. There is also a currency, crowns, that you earn by winning games. It gives you an extra incentive to win, but because you can get a few crowns by leveling up, if you save up you can get the items you want most eventually even if you have trouble getting wins.

The game is still pretty new, and still needs some work. The server issues since launch definitely need straightening out, and the game could definitely use a few new modes, or a little more variation on some of the current modes to make it more interesting, as the games can get a little repetitive when you've been playing for a while.

Overall, Fall Guys is an enjoyable game that has plenty of room to improve but is still very promising. 9/10",True

My review 11 out of 10

Game Of The Year!!",True
"The game has INSANE potential, but the developers didn't bother playing it I guess.

After 5 games, you know already what's wrong with the whole thing.

Team games are shit. Imo, the game should have 2 queues, 1 for solo games, 1 for team games. 
If not, don't make it 100% to play a team game. Lower the chances. None enjoys the team games, for god's sake.

Final games are INSANELY bad. 
Royal fumble is a joke. Why the winner should be the one with the lowest ping? 
Desync is way too hard, it's annoying. People are stealing your tale from 10m away and there are times you cannot steal it while you're melee. Ffs. The game should be working in a different way, the more you keep the tail, the more points you get. It's STUPID, giving the win to the one stealing it in the last millisecond.

Fall mountain, another joke. First of all the game is buggy, I've seen people bunching literally on the crown and none gets a win. Also, the game depends a lot on the position. First row has always advantage, why don't you see it? Also, sometimes it's pure RNG, just in the end of the first part, 2 balls will drop on your head, which are undodgable.

Block party and roll out should become harder. It's insane that on block party most of the times you just have 2-3 people falling. Make it harder, for god's sake. Roll out, you can just walk forth and back between blue and pink and just win, easily. No matter what. Same for the memory game. You just run with everyone, and that's it.

Most games, do not punish the players. The best game by far is the ""Slime climb"". It requires some kind of skill, at least.
And also, if you're just purely bad, you'll get into the slime and you'll lose. For the rest of the games, you just fall again and again with zero impact. For example, first game ""See saw"". You can be afk 3' and still win, because the game WON'T PUNISH YOU. Give people 3 lives per map or something like that, punish them for being bad.

Last but not least, the game needs more maps, now, especially, for finals. Current games are very bad.

I won't even bother giving suggestions on how to improve team games, they're very bad, no matter what.
Create different queue for premades only with team games only.

P.S How come you guys allow only parties of 4? How come you guys don't have custom games while the game has so much potential for streaming?",False
"This is a great game. I played the beta a lot and now I'm enjoying the release version. It never get boring, it's easy to understarnd and enjoy. It's a party game that you can play online and laugh a lot. Don't miss this game",True
"Game is not bad itself but the Anti-Cheat addition broke SteamPlay on Linux. 

I understand that it never was officially supported but addition client side anti-cheat is pretty much always a bad thing IMHO.

(will adjust my review once client side Anti-Cheat is removed or a native Linux version released)",False

Games good 10/10
needs more hugging",True
"This game has me in constant smiles, laughs, and curse words under my breath (in good fun) the entire time. I have had fun alone and with friends and would suggest this for both solo and multi play.",True
"[h1]My last 8 out of 10 final rounds ended with cheaters flying around winning them...[/h1]

▷ There is no way to report a cheater at this moment, since there are no unique player names, so even if you've made a screenshot there you can just wipe your --- with it.
There is no point to play this game until cheater problem will be fixed somehow, unless you really wanna feel frustrated losing almost every single game to them.

▷ The game crashes pretty much every time you're trying to Alt+Tab, sometimes it can crash if you're trying to use Steam overlay. I AltTabbed to write this review and the game crashed, lol.

▷ Constant server issues and disconnections, that are still not fixed.

[b]Overall[/b] this creates pretty unpleasant experience, so I wouldn't recommend you this game at the moment. Wait for the discount and fixes.",False
"So this game is worth it for the price.. sure. But it lacks a lot. Many minigames are just plain boring, some are average and good at best. 
There are server issues as others have said, but it isn't VERY likely to get into one. Happened 4 times in a few hours. It is 4 too much but they couldn't have predicted the game to become this popular at release.

Look away if you don't have any friends to play with lol

It lacks a lot of minigames. They could easily take some minigames from minecraft servers, some TV shows, browser games and make this game A LOT better. 

The microtransaction in this game isn't the worst one I've seen but there is no ""unlockable content"" except for the season pass thing (this isn't a buyable one yet) and item shop. The currency (KUDOS) you can buy is also the currency you get by playing. This currency can get you skins and other small stuff in the item shop. The items rotate and is not the same each day. Also the items are not very interesting.

No crossplay yet but it may happen in the future I hope.

The loading screen between rounds is kind of bugged. When a new minigame is loading it shows text in the top left corner saying ""next up is.."" and it scrolls through the multiple minigames but it never lands on a picture with the correct minigame. I suggest putting the players in a lobby, maybe the one when you see players being eliminated in, and after elimination put a wheel in which will scroll through all the available minigames for that round and show us which one it hits etc. and then load.

Unfortunately it doesn't feel worth it to win unless the legendary skin set in the item shop is godtier. You only get one crown by winning. You need 5 to buy a ""legendary"" skin in the item shop.

Please add steam names to friends that you qued up with atleast, and when you go spectating please add that if you qued up with a friend it will spectate him first and his steam name in the corner.

Also one last addition could be a fun leaderboard. Example: Fastest time on a race minigame. Best score etc.

I think Fall Guys will become better with time and to see a new indie game get all of this attention is good.
It becomes very repetitive after awhile but if you need a game for short bursts of fun this game is for you. Fall Guys will also tilt the f out of you btw gl

"A fresh take on the Battle Royale genre with a Mario Party minigame feel to it.

Overall Fall Guys is a really fun game, especially if you play it with friends. The game isn't really grindy, the controls are simple and it's not pay2win. You can earn Kudos by playing the game, progressing through the Battle pass which is free or by buying them from the store. You can also earn crowns from winning Episodes/Games and you can't buy them from the shop with real money. The servers had a few issues recently, but now they're trying to upgrade them so we all can experience Fall guys without server problems :)",True

"yes, the servers have been a bit wack and disconnecting, but its only because the game has blown up much more than they could handle. give them the benefit of the doubt and enjoy a fun, battle royale / party game
for a game that resembles those obsticle course game shows, theres plenty of fun maps to play, as the game cycles through them randomly for you. I noticed new maps were slowly revealed to me after the first couple hours of playing too. 
the two different currency types in the game can both be earned WITHOUT any transactions which is fantastic. Win a game - get a crown. play the game - get money. The battle pass style level up system is also free. these guys have really done a great job and deserve all the hype theyre getting. I look forward to playing a lot of this game! :)",True
Needs a functional anti-cheat.,False
"This game is unbelievably fun.
It offers the same levels of satisfaction that your typical BR would offer, and subtracts all the stress.

THANK GOD this game is pay to play, because that means we get free access to the seasonal battle-passes, which are filled with awesome cosmetics. And after every match, you earn Kudos, which is the currency used in the cosmetic shop, which is also updated daily.

Every mini-game I have played has been so much fun. And with the promise of new and altered variations of mini-games for each season, my hype couldn't be higher. This is the breath of fresh air the ""BR"" formula needed.

I have 11 hours in the full release, and 13 in the closed beta, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. I will continue to play and promote this game throughout it's life, as long as the amazing people at Mediatonic continue to do the fantastic job they have done already.

The review bombs here are people angry because they can;t get into a game, because the game was 500K viewers on Twitch! #1! That's INSANE for an indie game of this size. So naturally review-bots are bombing the game angrily, because they are angry they can't get into a game, because the game is so much fun. 

Give the devs a bit to get the issues sorted. They are working on it! Check their Twitter.

Don't pass up on this game. It's a gem, and one to be praised for the massively consumer friendly marketing model, and pure love poured into the development. Keep checking this review for my hours if you don't believe me. They will continue to grow.",True
"I played 20+ Hours of the Beta and the game is absolutely magnificent.
I think people that are giving it a bad review early because of day 1 server issues is stupid. 
Please wait before you review a game, actually play it first.

All about this game is wonderful.
It reminds me a lot of Takeshi's Castle.",True
"The closed beta was extremely fun and addictive. On launch day, there have been a lot of server problems because of the vast amount of people trying to connect. I sort-of expected this, since the same thing happens to a lot of hyped online games on release day, especially when they're indies. Does that mean I should give this a negative score? No way! I'm sure they'll work through their current server issues as fast as possible, and the game itself is very good.

It does need more courses, yes, but even though I told myself after my first session that I was going to wait and see how it develops, I still jumped back in the very next day because I was already hooked. That's what's great about it: it starts up fast and you get into matches fast, so it's the perfect game to just jump into, fast, for a bit of fun between other things...or you could play all night like my friends and I did.

It has a vast amount of potential. I just really hope that they release an editor and allow the community to create and upload their own courses. This would obviously make for amazing longevity.

"Fall Guys is an extremely simple & fun idea that is handled extremely awkwardly, leading to not immediately obvious but incredibly frustrating issues. The entire game plays out as a battle royale platformer game show, so randomness is expected, but the issues make the randomness a lot more unfun than a game like Mario Party for example.

The game has a very narrow focus; there is only one ""mode"" you can play. The only thing to do is join matches to try to win. From this, you gain coins for a cosmetic shop, crowns for rarer items, and experience for your seasonal battle pass.
These are the only things to play for (other than having fun with your friends obviously), so these are going to be the goals you set. But the game almost goes out of your way to prevent you from doing so.

You gain experience at such a pathetic rate compared to how much you need to level up, you'd need to play for hours to level up once in the later ranks. The lack of achievable progress makes it a chore to set goals in this game. For reference, you need 2500 exp to get to rank 38 & 3000 exp to get to rank 39. Earlier ranks increase the needed amount by 100 or 200 from before. You only get ~25 exp from round 1, ~120-130 exp from round 4, & ~300 exp from winning. So even if you get to the penultimate or final round at 4 rounds, you'll barely make any progress starting around rank 25 or so.

This is made way worse by the random, unavoidable disconnects that will drop all your progress. I went through 5 rounds involving some of the most random-chance games including Tail Tag (which doesn't matter until the final 20 seconds), got to last 5 people from 11, and DC'd. Why would I want to queue again after that? All of my effort was wasted, all the good luck pointless. I didn't gain anything, and the fun was undercut by the match being cut prematurely with no reward. If this game only has one way to play, one thing to do, why would it not save your rewards on a round-by-round basis? Randomly disconnecting is so disheartening.

Then there's grabbing. There's a handful of issues with grabbing.

Similarly related to disconnects, the network latency leads to grabbing consistently being unfair in tail games, because to grab their tail, you have to be on top of them and hold it for a full second, but when they chase you, they can grab you from 2-3 arms-lengths away. So its incredibly hard & frustrating to attempt to avoid being tagged in the Tail or Jinx games as you have to work a lot harder than they do from your perspective. You can't just sprint away, you need to have not fallen and have grabbed them close to some obstacle to get between you and Stretch Armstrong. 

This is not an every-now-and-then issue, this is just the way grabbing works. And when 5 game modes revolve around Grabbing and Avoiding being grabbed (Tail Tag, Team Tail Tag, Final Tail Tag, Jinx, & Egg Scramble), this makes every match with them incredibly unfun. And that's not even going into the uses of grabbing players in other game modes.

Another bad aspect of grabbing is that the grabber comes out of the grab before the other person. So if they grab and hold you, then let go, you are stunned longer in a release animation than they are. This is incredibly frustrating and unfair. So if you are with someone on Hexagon or the Jump Club or Block Party, someone can quickly grab and release then jump over the obstacle while you are stunned and can do nothing but fall and die, as you are unable to move. If anything, it should be the opposite; the grabber should have a longer recovery animation, to balance out grabbing people.

Then there's the fact that there is no clean way to break from a grab. You just have to wiggle back and forth until it decides to break, but that doesn't always work in your favor, and it's out of your control whether or not it does. Sometimes, due to game physics, even breaking from a person's grab will launch you in the direction they were pushing, regardless of where you were trying to go. This can obviously kill you in small platform levels. Sometimes, due to game physics, even if you are pushing back at the same rate, you will be the one determined to be constantly pushed back until your opponent pushes you off the level, and there was nothing you could do; breaking out would've just launched you out anyways, and pushing back did nothing. So that needs to be fixed.

But also, I think Diving should instantly break out of a grab and knock down the person grabbing, pushing them away if you dive in their direction. I think this provides more interaction between the only 3 actions (Jump, Dive, Grab), can't be spammed as Diving requires you to land & recover before Diving again, and can put you in a dangerous position as it forces you forward into a ragdoll. This would allow players a more consistent way to play around grabbing.

I'm also tentatively thinking there should be a way to recover from a ragdoll quicker, as there are many moments where you are pushed over, knocked around, drug, etc. and you can't recover and avoid an oncoming obstacle.

This isn't necessarily all of the issues with the game, just some that make playing the game incredibly unfun.

TL:DR
Network needs to be fixed to fix grab length and save/give rewards every round, Diving should break Grabs, and either Rewards should be notably increased or Rank requirements notably decreased.",False

I have enjoyed the game so far and I think I'll be playing this for a long time. I just hope the developers are able to sort out the server issues and are able to release a steady flow of new content.  If they are not able to then I don't see this game lasting for long.,True
"This is without a doubt one of the best and funniest games I've ever played. I have no regrets about giving 20€ for the game and to be honest, it diserves it's price. 
I'd recommend you to play this if you want endless hours of fun, alone or with friends, which is the best part. While in the majority of video games you play with your friends, in this game you play against your friends, because there can only be 1 winner, and that's what makes the game more fun to play.
The goal of the game is to get 1st place out of 60 people. The game consists on multiple minigames and you need to get qualified in order to move on to the next minigame. Each round a few people get eliminated until you get to the last round where the few people left need to fight for the spot 1 to win the match. There are multiple gamemodes such as races, team games and logic games.
I overall love the idea of the game as well as the characters, mechanics, music, style and colours. Also there is a battle pass which is entirely free where you just have to play to get rewards. Also the in-game prices for you to buy skins, emotes, etc are super balanced and to be honest I've never seen a game with such generous prices. You can buy stuff with Kudos (game currency) or with crowns, which you can get with the battle pass or if you get 1st place in a match (you get a crown for each win).
Of course like in every other game there are some issues and I'm about to discuss them now. There are some hackers in the game (fly hackers or speed hackers), which for me personally is super rare to find and the game servers lag sometimes forcing you to get back to the main menu, tho I don't blame the developers too much since they have millions of people playing everyday and I know how hard it must be to have servers that can get thousands of players.
The game itself doesn't require alot of skill, the problem is that sometimes you can get screwed up by a teammate that is either afk or is not very good at the game (which is also rare) or other players that are against you (I'll talk about it a bit later). Sometimes you can even get screwed up by timing because every race map is full of obstacles that can throw you out of the map, making you respawn in your last checkpoint or even eliminate you entirely from the match, so timing will be your best friend lots of times.
You can also pull other players for your advantage, sometimes screwing them over (and they can do the same to you) and you're probably thinking you're going to get frustrated or angry, but trust me, you're going to laugh. After all it's not as easy as it looks to get a win between 60 people so my best advice is to not get near a big wave of players.
So concluding this review, I love the game and I would recommend it to anyone a million times. It's really worth it's price and it's hella fun. Hop in and get some crowns! But don't fall in the slime ;)",True

[h1] Written Review [/h1]
Fall Guys is a fantastic multiplayer game that will have you laughing constantly.

The aim is to play through Takeshi's Castle-like challenges, and be the sole survivor in a match of 60 players.
There's a very good variety of games. Some emphasise speed, while others are all about positioning and strategy. None of them are hard to grasp, although they can have a decently high skill ceiling if you play them enough and learn them.

While some games have elements of randomization, most do not, and I think that hurts the game a little bit. The most fun you can have is when everyone is at a level playing field, going into something completely new and fumbling their way through. The developers have stated they're looking into ways to randomizing existing levels in ways, which I think will help tremendously with bringing back the chaotic goodness when you start off, to also keeping levels fresh when being replayed.

Aside from that one complaint, I think the game is still tremendously fun. I've played it on and off since release, and still burst out laughing with friends. The game is super colourful, simple, character customization is cute, the music is awesome, and I highly recommend it!",True

"A really fun game, definitely worth the price for me. The physics are good, the characters are funny and the gameplay is unique. The only problems I've found so far:

 A couple of freezes, these have only happened when playing with friends and trying to leave the game. I've been able to Alt+F4 out of the game and still get XP and Kudos.

Exploiters. I've seen a few running around recently, often with increased speed or some weird teleporting that has knocked me and others around. My friend has also seen someone flying, but I'm unable to confirm it.

I understand that the game is in it's early stages and that these problems will be fixed as soon as possible. Other than that, the game has been mostly flawless and I've had a lot of fun moments so far.

I think this game has huge potential and will improve massively over this year, 9/10.",True
"Such a fun game... for those lucky enough to get good servers.
It's been over a month since launch and South America still has really laggy servers. Really. Laggy.

The delay. The lag. The balls teleporting on team matches. My tail getting stolen from a mile away.

Nice work on making an awesome game, sadly poor job on making this game properly playable online, at least for us south-americans.

"***Beware, there are cheaters in this game and you'll run into them often, currently finding them in 1 of 3 games. My advice is to just immediately quit the game and try again. Then again, there's no guarantee they aren't subtlety cheating. Nothing quite like getting all the way to the final game just for them to suddenly start flying or running ultra fast. Buy if you don't care about winning, aren't competitive, and are a ""it's more about the journey"" kind of person.**

Many claim Fall Guys is MXC the game. It's more like Fusion Frenzy with way less games and but more players crammed into the map. For what it is, it's not bad. The characters don't control the best but that's intentional, they're supposed to fall over and it does make for a goofy, awkward if somewhat frustrating time. With good friends and the right mind set you'll enjoy it, don't take it too seriously, have fun, laugh, and grab people.

The game has two different game types but many different games. You work with a team to complete an objective or you're out for yourself. There's races, objective type games, and one or two that require a bit of skill. Hex-a-drop and Slime Climb being my two favorite.

For Dev's: Races should be longer, needs more games, and less cheaters.  Just shamelessly steal idea's from Mario Party and Fusion Frenzy. The player base won't care, I promise, just do it.",False

Incredibly cute and charming, you can always have fun watching your little characters fall over and make the cute WOOWOOWOO noises.

however there is a darker side to the fun. you will see humanity for what it truly is, the greed, the spite, the aggressive need to take others to hell with them; you will see the worst humanity has to offer across every minigame, but mostly the team-based events. alliances will form and break in an instant, and those you consider friends will turn to view you as a stepping stone. there is no love among friends in this game, as there can only be one winner at the end.

still fun though, 9/10. could use more maps and skins.",True
I think the game is fun with friends but even than it is very infuriating. Sometimes you will get stuck and can't get up or will hit a wall that isn't there. The character will sometime just trip over nothing which depending on the situation will lead to death losing or losing tons of progress. I think it is fun but it doesn't feel refined enough. Like you will have people dive in front of you so you dive than you hit them even though they aren't there anymore. There also aren't enough game mods. It has a lot of potential but falls short.,False

[b]This game is a contender for my GOTY of 2020.[/b]

I feel like a kid in a candy store on Christmas morning all over again. And I've never been a kid in a candy store on Christmas morning.

I'll be the first to admit, I loathe BRs of almost all kinds. Fortnite is overrated. PUBG is overrated. I can tolerate The Darwin Project and previously reckoned it's probably the best BR I've played. Until now.

Fall Guys is absolutely incredible, whimsical fun; a BR that doesn't even take itself very seriously, with very quirky and floppy character designs that are a joy to control...or not. They're called Fall Guys because they do have a profligacy to fall over in a cute manner. The physics-based wackiness of falling, grabbing others and things is one of the mainstays of this charming game, and I actually find myself having a lot of fun, even in losing.

Everything from the level designs (reminiscent of game shows like Takeshi's Castle and Wipeout) to the skins screams joyfulness. The soundtrack also does a good job of that too, conveying the lively atmosphere - then again, as it was co-composed by the legendary Jukio Kallio, that should come as no surprise. The main menu song and the rewards screen theme are absolutely wonderful.

Although there are microtransactions and DLC skins, these are all purely cosmetic. You can still earn a lot of items just from playing; you don't need to spend on them if you don't want to. I do not mind that they exist; after all, this is a one-time paid game, and if you want to throw more money at Mediatonic to help support server costs, maintenance, and keeping them able to develop more skins and free levels (for those worried about the potential repetitiveness), this is a terrific avenue with which to do so.

Yes, there may be some teething issues with the servers from time to time. This is to be expected with multiplayer games that really weren't expecting this amount of popularity. Consider this a GOOD thing, that there are many people interested in the game, who will be playing it for a while to come. (And yes, I was initially skeptical due to the 60 player per lobby limit, but my fears that I'll never be able to find matches are now all but assuaged.)

[h1]When to buy[/h1]
I'm just going to throw all the objectivity out the window. Get. It. Now. And when you do, play it for as long as you can. Keep the servers rolling (but don't kill them so I can play a bunch myself!).

but if this game never gets updates i will be giving negative later",True
"A fun and charming game. Much better than Fortnite, Apex, and Warzone as its actually fun to play. Sure its time consuming when on a losing streak but once learned it becomes a even better game overall. Fall Guys is a perfect example of how the old school party battle royale games are sorely missed in todays games. Yes, Fall Guys is the closet thing we have to Mario Party and thats a great thing to say about this game. Its like Wipeout on steroids with fluffy costumes. Overall a superb funny and nice game to play solo and with friends. Just be prepared to cry, scream, rage quit and laugh all at the same time.",True
"MXC, but in cartoon form",True
"Was initially hesitant to buy this as i thought it was just another streamer grab game, plus the $30 price tag for what looks like a $15 game. 
It is no doubt a $15 game as of now. While i like to think the other $15 is a fair donation of support to release new content, and to help the company continue the Fall Guys brand in becoming a common household party game name.

That said, i have no friends and it's still a very fun / annoying game",True
"This game is actually unplayable due to the rampant cheaters.And the developers don't give a single hoot.  Why should they?  They already robbed us of our money.Instead of doing anything about it, they're too busy with ""haha BIG YEETUS :)) funny Memes are we relatable and Cool yet kids?"" while counting their dollars.Really wish I could refund this garbage and support actual respectable developers, y'know?UPDATE: Now they've screwed over Linux users.  Real cool.",False
"Used to watch wipeout when i was a kid, The fact that this game make me feel i'm part of it is amazing.

"After being out for a month and working perfectly on Linux via Proton, I decided to finally grab a few licenses for the computers in my home. Less than a week later, they have added Easy Anti-Cheat, basically blocking me out of the game and refusing me a refund now. 

The game worked on Linux from day 1 - whether the devs intended it to or not. There are anti-cheats that work on Linux - they chose one that intentionally blocks Linux (EAC used to work on Linux before Epic bought them).

"Fall Guys can be a lot of fun to play through when you're just bored and have nothing better to do.
But there is one big issue.... this game is riddled with hackers who just teleport to the end of every match making it impossible to win. I'll change my review later once the hackers are brought to a minimum.",False
"They got Easy Anti-Cheat, which supports Linux, but not Proton. They also didn't make a Fall Guys native Linux build.",False
I love touching people.,True
"Definitely worth your while, bring a friend or two or three, they'll enjoy it too! 
 It's a small download, and it's very easy to get into. It's a pleasant game you can hop into without having to commit an extensive amount of time in order to enjoy it. On the other hand, a ""10 minutes, in and out"" session usually turns into a two hour struggle to prove you can make it to first place just one time. Then again, at that point you're not enjoying it; you're just pulling your hair out in rage.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go buy a wig...



I do have a few slice of life requests for the devs I would like to make:

- If I am knocked out before my friends, I have to shuffle through all of the other players to find them. If there was a way for the spectator cameras to prioritize players in the same party, I would much appreciate it!
- Also, after a round, it is sometimes hard to find your party buddies on the board. If something was implemented to make them stand out, I would love that as well.",True
"game's great, server problems but get over it it'll fix itself. positive reviewing to try and help with the negative review bombs.",True
"Easy, goofy, fun at a fair price.",True
I was having some fun the first days of gameplay but now every game I enter has one hacker on it. It sucks the fun out. The fact that it does not have a report system is a HUGE problem people are cheating on a game that has no reason to be cheated on and removes any enjoyment I could have with this game.,False
The amount of people using hacks make this game totally unfair and unplayable atm.,False
"All bad reviews are because of first day server issues. Even biggest companies having this issue. They dont deserve this attitude, its a bit harsh.",True
"Fun game from the little I've managed to play it, and some server issues are kind of to be expected, but this isn't early access, and prolonged radio silence on a nearly total 20-hours-and-counting server blackout while letting discord moderators openly antagonize, mock and lash out at people who aren't satisfied with the situation is... a pretty damning look for the future. Not refunding yet, but not going over 2 hours played for a while either, just in case.

Edit: since posting this review I have learned that the developers and their associates have complained about being ""review bombed"", dismissed complaints about server issues because ""other games had worse launches"", and told customers multiple times that they ""are free to refund and leave"". So yeah, even though that wasn't directed at me, it [i]does[/i] sound like really good advice the more you think about it, doesn't it?",False
"Game has a lot of potential and is fun but all games are plagued with cheaters, unfortunately the devs doesn't seem to be able to deal with the issue, so I can't recommend a game where it is impossible to win because of being multiple cheaters in all games.",False

"this game is LACK OF CONTENT. 

Fun game if you just wanna enjoy some happy time with you friends, but you will feel bored after the first hour. the same contents repeat again and again. 

not worthy.",False
"I will change my rating once they officially change the name of this game to Hacker Guys, because that's all it is. Every other game some kid with uncle issues will just start flying towards the finish line on round one. Honestly though, those kids annoy me less than the ones that are actually semi-okay at the game and only cheat to win the final, because at least with the awful hackers I can leave the game instantly rather than waste 15 minutes of my life before someone displays the gaming equivalent of a chav honking at 12 year old girls from their Corsa in a McDonalds carpark.

In fact the only thing more frustrating than the hackers themselves is Oliver Aged 24, the ""Community Manager"", who seems to think joking about the situation and then begging people not to post videos or report hackers 'because it will stop people wanting to buy the game', is a good example of what a community manager should do. They also claim that the hackers get banned at the end of matches, which seems unlikely because it's rare you'll see one that isn't displaying an outfit which cost a minimum of 7 wins and a completed battlepass.

Was a great game in the beta, love the mechanics, love almost everything about it. I've played for almost 200 hours since launch, plus 100 in beta, and I've got 100+ wins, so I'm not review bombing the game unjustly. Fix the hacker problem now as a priority and stop making jokes about it and asking people not to talk about it.",False
Although this game is buggy and servers aren't the best to start the game is still highly entertaining. It even makes it better the more people you have in your party and it's a one of a kind game that I'm sure will start a movement in games to influence more created similar to it. Ez game to pick up and play on the spot. There's just the right amount of fun and frustration to keep the game refreshing and not too easy or hard.,True

This game includes micro-transactions in the form of in-game purchases of currency, although you earn currency just from playing. The currency is then used to unlock costumes and cosmetics for your character. Not a bad system, but I know that triggers some people, so I'm mentioning it.",True
I would avoid this game until the devs implement some actual anti-cheat. They claim to have a robust anti-cheat detection system that bans hackers as soon as the game ends. This is an out-right fabrication. These days you're lucky to get a single hacker-free game. It's literally as easy as opening up cheat engine and loading a trainer. What a joke.,False
"Ever wish you were on MXC or The Floor Is Lava TV shows? You know, the ones where you're running through an obstacle course, dodging things, or trying to accomplish an amazing physical feat? Well Fall Guys let's you experience just that with 60 other people all at the same time without feeling the pain, well, only the pain of losing. Pretty rock solid game with or without friends, but I feel (and kinda hope) there will be updates in the future.

Fall Guys follows a very simplistic [b]gameplay[/b] format which means the controls are quite simple. Sometimes, less can be more in the sense of challenge. The art (or draw) of the game comes from the maps and objectives themselves. The point of the game is essentially to make it to the end, whether it's running through fans, dodging fruit on an incline, jumping from one uneven see-saw to another uneven see-saw, or trying to remember which fruit picture was on which tile. The game follows a sequence of five events in which players that do not qualify are removed from the next game. Unlucky for those who don't get to play the real fun maps! It's also slightly unlucky that the game doesn't allow players to choose which maps or game-modes they want to play. All is generated from the server side of things, which is okay, but it would be nice to play the maps YOU want to play! The main controls of the game are movement, jump, dive, and grab. Grab is a funny one as sometimes you'll see people trying to grab your character, preventing it from reaching the finish line. 

The [b]graphics and visuals[/b] are very vibrant and colourful. I really adore the colour scheme they've decided to go with, in addition to allowing players to customize their characters. It fits perfectly in the goofy and lively atmosphere. All the important animations are there and are surprisingly very smooth. Seeing someone get whacked by a propeller and going flying is quite a sight to see. The [b]sounds and music[/b] are pretty funky and definitely ramp up the player. I really appreciate the bass playing during the main menu - solid slapping technique! 

Overall, the game is pretty fun and is different than the usual run and gun found on steam. I really appreciate the PC gaming world having this sort of unique approach to an idea and implementing it properly to a game. I think they followed through on an awesome idea to allow people to feel what it's like to go through a fun obstacle course, but do have a little work ahead of them in adding finishing touches that will keep their player base consistent. New maps, new game modes, new options, and even allowing local play with online might keep things interesting. I received this copy as a gift, but I would recommend a purchase on sale.

"This game suppose to be relaxing, fun and entertaining. At least thats what I thought when I purchase this game.  However, the reality was completely different in my case. Very frustrating and irritating gameplay, players who hold you purposefully at fhe finish so you cant continue and therefore are eliminated (happend to me several times now), hackers who made one jump and finish the map, no I am done with this game.",False
"The map rotation absolutely sucks in this game, I keep getting the same maps over and over again. (NEEDS MORE MAPS)
Then its also unfair when you get put into a team game with less players than other teams.
The bugs, its just awful the one map where you have to run to the top to grab the crown and it literally blocks you from grabbing, it just should not be happening.
Not even to mention how bad the servers are. 
Would only recommend to buy the game when 70% sale, definitely not worth the money...",False

The game will only get better as more maps/game modes are added over the seasons, but as it sits right now, Fall Guys has a really strong core to play off of.  Highly Recommend.",True
"really fun time, the devs clearly care a lot about this game, and I love that. it's just goofy fun, and I love how i'm laughing in a battle royale game. soooo much potential, excited to see what updates come next!


10/10, would fall again",True
"Before the official release, a bunch of my friends were already talking about this game. I found it funny seeing how the game looked like a childhood show that I used to watch called Wipeout, but instead of falling into the water, you'd find your bean fall into pink slime. The game so far has a cute art style and unique cosmetics, from cute bookworm owls to knights in shining armor, that are free to play. These can be bought with kudos and crowns which can be earned through playing through rounds and winning games which is much more appealing to me than being forced to buy skins I really like with money. 
Most of the time I find myself playing with a bunch of my friends to the point of staying up way too late for my own good. Screaming over protecting our teams tails or balls to competing over who get's the 1st place gold metal while trying not to lose ourselves to falling in the creeping slime. I find this game definitely can appeal to multiple age groups through it's cute and simple style. I highly recommend this really fun party game to anyone who wants to give it a chance. I hope you enjoy this game just as much as I have!",True

"While the game is fun for a few hours (especially with friends) i cannot recommend it right now at $20 US dollars. It lacks depth in its gameplay and thats what makes it fun & easy to play and understand, however, it does not compensate that with content at the moment. Eventually it started to feel boring and repetitive.",False
"So much fun. The team games makes me wanna die though, especially Fall Ball. Aside from that, this game is simply FUN and I can't wait for more maps to be added in the future!",True
"Great fun, but recently in every single game I've encountered at least one hacker. There seems to be no anti-cheat, the hackers have complete anonymity so you can't even trash talk them let alone report them.
 
Would not recommend buying before they implement an actual *working* anti-cheat system.",False
"This game is amazing, wonderful, and its fun. The Minigames are not hard and the characters are adorable. 
I say it is not a game you can get upset at. You lose some minigames and you win some. But in by the end of it, you have a lot of fun. 
Yes there are bugs and Servers are struggling, but the devs are working on their game very very hard. 
Whether you wait to get it on sale or buy it right away...I think it is worth it. 
Hope to see you in the Mini games and Enjoy!",True
"Good and fun game, but I really can't give it a positive review until the cheaters are gone or at least heavily reduced.

Other things that should be fixed:
The Netcode is terrible... don't know another game with such terrible desync. Especially in the finale with ~10 players it should not be that hard to handle correct timings.
Team games with 3 teams are more about fucking up the 3rd team and when it's 2vs1 there's really not much you can do about it.
Team games, especially with 2 teams, really shouldn't be uneven... the soccer game with 4vs5 is just unfair.
When you spectate you can't even recognize party members.
Are Names ever coming back again? What's so hard about it...
I'm not convinced grabbing is a good mechanic, it just encourages toxic behavior.

I have ~4 hours play time meaning that I am ineligible for an automated refund.    The developers have not yet reached out to steam to allow refunds for Linux gamers like or Psyonix did when the dropped Linux support or Doom Eternal when they added Denuvo anti-cheat.

"The game was great initially. Like any multiplayer game with lots of players - cheaters came along.
As of the time of writing this review - the game is flooded with cheaters, to the point that cheaters are found in most matches (*they all start with 60 players).

It's a good thing that the game has no statistics at all, because losing to cheaters is common and motivation to keep playing the game drops down by the match.

A better anti-cheat system has to be implemented, as well as a report system so that the players won't feel so powerless against those cheaters.

Would not recommend playing as long as cheating is a massive common issue.",False
"Fall Guys is indeed fun. However, I cannot recommend it in its current state. There are so many goddamn hackers who ruin the experience for everyone. The moment you spawn in you'll either see a bunch of dudes flying in the air or you will immediately see the qualifiers counter go from something like 0/40 to 1/40 or 3/40.

[h1]What is okay[/h1]
The game on itself is okay and fun to play with friends.

- it run well
- The game design is nice
- the ost will be stuck in your head for ever

[h1]What is NOT okay[/h1]
- The game as no split screen
- The game has no local multiplayer 
- The game does not allow you to host a private game
- net code is very questionnable (and remember no local multiplayer)
- game server crash (and remember no local multiplayer)
- not a lot of mini games
- The game has no filter or playlist on what minigame your gonna play 
[b]NO I DON'T WANT TO PLAY A TEAM MINIGAME WHEN I SOLOQ !!![/b]
- The game has no level editor
- The game do not use your steam/custom name but a random number
- [strike] [b][u]The Game has no anti cheat and is currently UNPLAYBLE (1/2 game have a cheater in it)[/u][/b][/strike] [b][u]** HAS BEEN FIXED **[/u][/b]
- The ui is SLOOOOW because everything has animation to it and you can't interact with it if the animation isn't finished. 
want to exit to main menu when game is over? you should just press echap right ? 
nonono you have to press echap wait a promt to show up (it take for ever for it to pop) and then valid the prompt.
you didn't quit to main menu before the next minigame start in the case of you don't made it to final ?
Too BAD ! now wait a f***ing loading screen and all the f***ing animation to be finished to be able to quit a game you are NOT in !
When you play with friend spec them is a pain because you have to scroll every player in the game to find them. (and remember no steam/custom name)
- The game has obvious bugs
The Vsync option is broken, you have to disable it in the settings menu in order to ACTUALY enable it.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
The game is lacking too much things and has too much to be working on to be sold at the current price or even to be called finished.

If you can have the game for free or for 4$ it is okay.
Else wait for the game to be updated and have more content.",False

"The premise of Fall Guys is simple and incredibly addicting. You're a cute little dude who is competing with up to 59 other players to be #1 and obtain the crown, by qualifying round after round in ""Mario Party"" or ""Wipeout"" style mini-games. 
In reality, you waddle around with up to 59 other players behind their computers yelling ""DAMN IT!"" , ""REKT!"" or ""GGEZCLAP!"" depending on who you are and whether or not you had a decent round.
Some notable game features and/or things to do in-game include:
-Multiple character customization options.
-The ability to queue for an episode with your friends.
-Seasonal rewards, currently with no additional purchase necessary.
-Earn season exp and ""Kudos"" (one of the currencies) for every game played.
-Earn ""Crowns"" by winning episodes or unlock some via the season rewards.
-An in-game shop with an inventory that changes daily.
-Spend your ""Crowns"" and ""Kudos"" in the shop to further customize your character.
-The ability to grab other players in an attempt to gain an advantage and/or ruin their day.

9/10- I love this stupid game so much. It's currently brand new and is ""a bit more popular than the devs had anticipated"", therefore the servers do seem to struggle often enough, though you're still able to play most of the day.

"Fall Guys is a very fun take on the Battle Royale genre mixed with popular TV entertainment such as Takeshi's Castle or Wipeout. The core gameplay is fun alone, but playing with friends will take things up quite a lot.

Currently, there is a good amount of content, and they will be adding more maps and features over time. As it stands, I played in the beta for 13 hours and the public release for 2. At this point, I'm still not deterred by repetition of maps but it is certainly a noticeable thing that we're dealing with.

Since they will be adding maps and content over time, I think this is a worthwhile purchase. If you love Mario Party, old Roblox, Jackbox Party Packs, things like that.. then you'll be right at home here.",True

"Ultrawide support is, ""not a priority"". Fair enough, leaving a positive review pointing out the nicer aspects of this game is no longer my priority. Shove it you two bit, lazy, greedy hacks. No 21:9 and £16 + Fortnite style MTXs. Piss take if ever I've seen one.

That point made, the game itself is...fine. The servers and net code are just not up to scratch. Servers regularly disconnect, and as can be seen from the numerous reports on the subreddit, player-to-player de-sync is a massively common issue. It results in tail grabs from distances of 6FT+, and victories robbed from you because, even though you were in the lead on your screen, everyone else's screen has someone else in the lead by 3FT. Add in the poor VFR that has balls and player animations visibly stuttering, aggressive monetisation, lack of basic technical features and trolls in every third game; this fun break away from the hyper-competitive-shooter obsessed industry becomes impossible to recommend.

Jokes aside, major props to the level designers, artists and sound team. Stunning work. Sorry everyone else you're stuck working with let you down.",False
"very fun, has Mario party mini game vibes :D super simple yet makes me want to play for hours. 

Only cons are they the server sucks half the time. It'll kick you out to the lobby. Sometimes the map freezes. And sometimes the esc tab doesn't work and you can't leave, even after you've been eliminated so you have to either sit and watch the whole round or restart the game. that part isn't so gucci gang. 

But the rest of it kinda makes up for it :)",True
Really fun game. It's competitive but not toxic in any way in my opinion. So far it's been a blast and i haven't even won once :).,True
"In a world that has been flooded with Battle Royale games, it’s strange to see a game that requires 60 people with one winner rise above so many. Fall Guys managed to take that formula along with classic physical game shows that have been around for decades and made something truly unique. Then on top of that, it works so well it almost feels weird that a game like this didn’t already exist.

Abbreviated Review: https://youtu.be/4TRlMdIQPHU

[h1]The Fun Parts[/h1]
Putting 60 people in the shape of rolly-polly jellybeans with arms and legs on one map is bound to be wild. When you have 24 of those maps featuring all sorts of weird bouncing surfaces, spinning floors, flailing propeller blades, and swinging wrecking balls, it’s absolute chaos. Somehow, that chaos feels very appropriate in Fall Guys. The maps that work best are the ones that alternate between spreading people across perilous regions and piling them together. Then they just let physics do its job.

The thrill of making it through some maps successfully is consistent nearly every time you play. Not all maps are equally thrilling, but succeeding is always extremely rewarding. You can’t always win though, obviously, but the frustration of defeat is short-lived. It’s easy to jump right back in a match and try it all again. Fall Guys always gives the feeling of being just moments from a deluge of entertaining insanity.

The game show styled atmosphere is prevalent, but the real thrills come if you manage to make it through the rounds toward the end. The smaller groups create a competitive atmosphere and the minigames you take part in enhance that. Here, even when you move away from the mayhem of the race maps, the tension builds with things like pitfalls creating instant elimination. As fun as it is to run through the foam-padded walls of the earlier maps with 60 people, the final rounds are often the most exciting parts of the Fall Guys experience.

[h1]The Less Fun Parts[/h1]
Fall Guys isn’t perfect though. There are moments throughout the game that sparks that frustration, fleeting as it is. The one that got to me the most is the way the physics work in some areas. At times, your character will respond normally to impacts with items and other players. Other times, however, it’s like gravity gets shut off and you completely malfunction. There have been countless times where it seemed like my legs just weren’t working anymore. My little bean man would fall over and roll around as people waddled by me. The weeble wobble nature of these characters is obvious, but the inconsistency is what bogs things down.

Then, of course, the quality of the maps can vary significantly depending on the goals and designs. Team games can be fun, but can also make your whole run feel like a waste as you go from fighting solo to relying on ten other people to be even marginally ok at these events. The map “Perfect Match” feels notably out of place and often ends with one or two people being eliminated. In addition, some of the two dozen maps seem to rarely show up for me. I’ve played Slime Climb maybe five times in total while I’ve been on Whirlygig probably more than half of my dozens of matches. This all makes the quality of each run unpredictable.

One of the less significant issues I have is that loading can often take as long as a whole map. It can be disappointing to play for a minute and then wait another minute for the players to drop off and the next map to load. If they could somehow load all the maps from the start that would streamline the round structure and make it feel more fluid.

[h1]Autumn Dudes[/h1]
Fall Guys has been a breakout success, one of the largest ever for Devolver Digital. If the developers can follow up on this success with enough fixes and improvements, the game could follow in the footsteps of Rocket League. There is no guarantee though. While it currently maintains the illustrious third spot on Steam’s most played games, some feel the gameplay is limited. More maps are needed and, according to recent announcements, are soon to come.

Fall Guys isn’t a game for hardcore eight-hour-a-day gamers. It’s hardly even one that you need to invest more than an hour into at any given time. It just doesn’t provide the type of gameplay for long sessions. What it does best though is instill just enough of a sense of competition and the grandeur associated to keep you coming back. I find myself jumping in for three or four rounds in a row and moving on. Yet, I keep coming back.
  
I can’t imagine with all of the public appreciation and coverage from streamers and other content creators that this game will fade away any time soon. However, it’s up to Mediatonic to make sure that this time next year, the game is so full of maps and new mechanics that people will still be playing and making that content. For $20 (and as many microtransactions as you can avoid), I can’t see any reason not to have this ready and waiting to fall into whenever you’ve got the time.

"(NOTE: This review DOESN'T contain problems which Fall Guys aren't accountable for(For example, hackers or server crashing), as those problems aren't their fault. This review, however, DOES contain problems which Fall Guys aren't accountable for which makes it an unenjoyable experience)

Fall Guys WAS a good game. At first I found it fun and exciting to play in such a colorful and bright environment which definitely helped take my mind of things going on in the outside world(Covid). It was unique and very wholesome which I didn't expect to play when I play games of very different genres(Factorio, Hammerwatch, and Among Us).

However this was at first...

The unique physics engine can be really annoying and cause a lot of BS situations when playing. The physics can cause for uncalled for moments where you randomly fall down and fall off the map resetting all your progress resulting in potentially making you lose the round and possibly losing a final round. 

What I find worse about this game is that it gets old; QUICKLY. Variety in this game is quite minimal when rounds are being selected. Rounds get boring quickly, especially when it is heavy reliable on luck over skill. In fact, most of this game is luck over skill. The physics result in situations where balls can fly randomly and are very uncontrollable. Team games result in having a cooperative time which have no way of cooperation with each other which defeats the purpose of ""a team"". Sure you can play with friends, but most of your team are probably random people who you can talk to. It is very fun losing because of a mistake you made and then learning from it to improve at the game. It isn't fun losing because of luck which granted certain players victorious over you because they got lucky for which doors they open, and which path worked. A lot of the minigames aren't even designed for mass players. For example, the race ""Slime Climb"" is too narrow and ends up with a lot of people blocking paths which halts all progression for everyone behind that one A-Hole.

To finish up, I did receive this game for free. My brother gifted it me, but that doesn't mean I didn't have anything to lose. I brought two copies for the game as gifts for friends. One heavily dislikes the game because of the same reasons as i have mentioned and the other likes it. By all means though, don't use this an example for a reason NOT to buy Fall Guys. This is mainly a heads up on what to expect during playing, and I think there is an awful lot to improve in this game and I do want to say I like the game, and I hope the developers make it a more enjoyable experience without a lot of RNG and BS.
",False
too many cheaters.. meh,False
"This game has so much potential especially as it blew up, the game is very fun but be warned that there are SO many hackers and the devs don't seem to have a method to deal with it. You will not have fun if you encounter any hacker in game (I basically encouter 2-3 hackers PER GAME which is absolutely atrocious), and they instantly fly to the finish line or levitate and zoom around at hyper speed which just makes the game unwinnable. I strongly recommend that you don't buy this game until this problem is fixed or else you won't have fun.",False
"Great game. No really I love this game!

It's a couch party type of game where enter a tournament to play minigames against 59 other players over 5 rounds. It's a game that makes me feel like I don't have to win ever to be able to have fun, and that's usually not how I usually think about a competitive game.

Now you might ask, why do I not recommend this game when I only say positive things about it?
One word: [b]Cheaters[/b]

They are absolutely [b]everywhere[/b], I didn't notice it at the start but now I can see them in every game I play. While this is a game I can see my self playing a lot without winning a single game, I can't enjoy a game I know for sure that I can't win at all. There's no reason to play a game I know with 100% certainty that I will lose the game 5 rounds in.

In the final round you play on one of 4 maps randomly. 2 of these maps is last fall guy standing. One is tail grab and the last one is a race to the top of a mountain. Since cheaters can increase speed, ignore knockback effects or straight up fly (and many more hacks), the first 2 maps is impossible to win against cheaters. The mountain race is possible against very [b]VERY[/b] bad cheaters ([url=https://twitter.com/i/status/1292251650778955782]there are some pretty funny videos out there[/url]) but that also depends on the hack. That leaves us with the tail grab. Winning on this map against a cheater is doable depending on what type of cheat they're using. if they use flyhax then it's over the moment the grab the tail. if they have speed mods or teleport mods it's doable.

To put more salt in your wounds there isn't any type of report system and all names are displayed with a 4 digit hashtag number so we can't even report their steam profile. Although this is the case currently, the developers have stated that they are working on fixing this. This is after all a new game so of course there will be issues at first. (speaking of issues if your cursor randomly pops up in a game you can press esc 2 times to remove it)

When cheaters don't appear in every game I start I will probably start playing this game again.

[b]TL:DR[/b]
It's impossible to win because there are cheaters in every game and you can't report them but it's ok cause the developers are working on it.",False
Too many hackers in the game. Otherwise it's a fun game.,False
"Fall Guys itself is an enjoyable if not repetitive 'battle royale' game based upon party style mini-games with 60 people. Ultimately it all comes down to 1 winner who receives a currency called 'Crowns', which can be used to buy high quality cosmetics in the in-game store. Crowns are not purchaseable with real money or any other in-game currency. There is another currency called Kudos, which are purchaseable with real money; however the need to buy them is extremely low as someone who goes out in even the second round can obtain quite a numerous amount - from both the game rewards it self, and the free battle pass. 

Fall Guys features an aforementioned free battle pass-like progression system, and XP of which is relatively easy to come by should you survive more than the first round on a consistent basis. The rewards on this battle pass vary from the in-game currency of Kudos, to cosmetics such as head and body items, along with faceplates, colours and patterns for the player's 'Bean'. 

The gameplay itself is extremely enjoyable and addictive for the most part, however due to the seemingly intended seasonal content releases, it's already becoming quite repetitive for some people - especially for those who play solo. There is a season two on the way in, as I write this, 27 days - which will bring new cosmetics, a new battle pass, and new minigames. 

There are a few negatives to the game, the aforementioned repetitiveness, a few bugs and server issues - and the biggest, which is hackers. Almost every other game for myself personally has been with a hacker in it, either one who flies or speed hacks. It makes the game almost unwinnable as the only way to eliminate this person is to hope that they disconnect, they bug out and somehow are eliminated, or that there's a winnable team game where their hacks can't influence it too greatly. There is an anti-cheat in the works that ought to be released very soon however, and I hope those who have had to put up with the hackers will be compensated in some manner. 

Overall, I'd recommend this game to other players only if they have friends to play it with. Even just a single friend can do, so long as it's someone you enjoy playing with; it makes the game a whole lot funner to have the company, and playing single player gets extremely repetitive for me personally - playing with a friend alleviates that somewhat. If you are someone who doesn't bore easily from repetitive multiplayer games, then I'd recommend this, friends or no friends. Similarly, I'd recommend this game to those who are only intending to play it for a few minutes every now and then, as opposed to something they'll grind non-stop. Fall Guys serves well as a casual game rather than something to pump hours upon hours into.",True
"Let me begin by saying that the game is a lot of fun, but in it's current state I cannot recommend buying this game, at least not at full price. The lack of anticheat and the nature of this game being a battle royale makes it a cesspool of cheaters. At one point, I played 7 consecutive games with one or more hackers in them. It felt like 4/5 games, I'd load in, see someone flying/using speedhacks, and I'd instantly leave. You're not going to win against a hacker, so why bother playing an entire match? 
The game modes are fun enough, and not much in the way of skill is required. It's an RNG game, so anyone can win. If you do decide to get it, make sure you have friends to play it with. The game is way more fun with company.

"No anti-cheat in 2020.

"I am writing this review during the first season of this game.

This game splashed on to the scene with a big bang, it still being in the top 5 streamed games on twitch and other platforms a month after it's original release. It's been a huge critical and commercial success with its amassed number of views on video platforms and purchases not being without merit.
I can truly say that i whole heartedly love this game with it's up lifting highs such as getting tossed around the WhirlyGig right to the finish line, kamikaze style soloing on a player on Perfect Match or fetching a tail for yourself in Tail Tag at the last possible moment, but it also has some small downs and a huge one which I am going to list in this review.

The pros:
-This game is packed to the brim with some of the most dopamine indusing fun you've had in years, be it battling it out in wrestling match with another player or racing your way to the finish line.
-It sports one of the biggest map pools of any battle royale, if you would be willing to call it that, of 25 maps, out of which 17 totally unique maps and 3 maps that split people into teams and are based around oversized soccer type balls, 2 based around evading a revolving pole, 3 that are tail tag based.
-Making exception of the team type of games which I am going to list in the cons, all of the other games require a surprising level of skill and strategy, be it learning to dive to the finish line at the most opportune timing to secure yourself a win on the first two maps, getting the hang of how to position yourself on the seesaws to ensure you having the highest elevation or engaging in grabing duels to eliminate your opponents.
-The skin sistem is one of the best i've seen since the introduction of microtransaction in 2014, the only currencies in the game being Kudos, which are the points you earn after each match, the amount depending on how far you've managed to qualify, and are the only ones which can be bought, the other currency being the crowns, of which you can snag one solely by being the no. 1 winner of a match.
-The game is very light and not resource intensive, meaning that it can be played even on older sistems without computing power or storage space.

The cons:
-The biggest game braking con of this game are the hackers. Out of every 5 matches joined 4 of those contain at least one hacker. This leads to a queuing time of around 15-20 minutes of finding a game, waiting for the first round to start only for a hacker to start flying at light speed toward the finish line, leaving the match, queuing for another one and repeating until finding a hacker free match.
This is unnaceptable and it makes the game not worth playing given the whole point of the game is winning. The other problem this has created is an utter scarcity of crowns, which are the only way of buying the legendary skins.
I can't get enough of this game, finding myself wanting to play it non stop but this hacker issues is rendering the game unplayable and seriously making me consider if I'm in for 15 minutes of queuing beetwen matches when launching the game.
-Another flaw of the game are the team based matches. With 2 thirds of the maps revolving around skill and strategy, these stick out as an unenjoyable sore thumb, making your way through 2 or 3 maps only to land on the team with all of the morons from which no amount of goal tending is going to save you from.
-Other small gripes I've had with the maps are the spawn positions, these forcing you to change strategies on the fly for the first round maps, which is something that I totally agree is fine, but that dictate whether you win or lose on the final map Fall Mountain ,and the slime not rising all the way up to the finish line in Slime Climb not allowing for last 5 second duels, and proceeding to automatically kill any players in the 2 meter space in front of the finish line.

The game is undoubtedly lots of fun and the most unique game of at least the last 2 years if you are willing to get the price tag of 20‎€, that some might consider steep for what is in the end an indie game, if you can get over that and the devs implement anti cheating mesures in the next updates to come you are in for a world of treat",True

The one thing I don't really like about the game is the hackers in the game, there are a lot of people in the game that use hacking to win, which spoils all the fun for everyone that's playing. I recommend having some sort of Anti-Cheat System so then no on e in this game can cheat their way to victory.

"Fall Guys is absolutely a fun game, albeit frustrating at least half the time. However, at it's current state I can't recommend purchasing the game. 

First and foremost, server issues lead to a number of problems including being suddenly disconnected from sessions, or things like grabs not registering with the correct timing (most apparently on final rounds when a crown is at stake). Secondly, modders/hackers are very common to come across from my experience. Within my first few hours of playing I have personally seen three and my friends have reported more. It goes without saying that in a multiplayer game where only one person can win, a hacker absolutely ruins the session for anyone else varying based on which events are chosen.

If more was done to combat those two issues then I would certainly recommend buying the game. Until then, I would suggest holding off.",False

"I like the game, I recommend it to others because the game is fun even if you lack friends to play it with (like me), you still tend to enjoy the game and currently there arent many game modes, but eventually they mentioned that they will add more maps, etc.. so its worth it :D",True
it could be a very funny and relaxing . but we need a report system to maintain a equitable Game Environment,True
"Fall Guys is all luck based. Unless I win, then it's skill.",True
"This game is just amazing! Fun for short runs, fun for long runs. Don't let 20$ price tag distract you if it is worth it, because trust me if you like platformer combined with battle royale game genre, it definitely is.

Pros:
-Gameplay is smooth and control work very well
-Game is playable for low-end PCs (you will have 30 fps even with integrated graphics on minimum settings)
-Games are quick and they will last max 15 mins if you reach the final stage
-Minigames are like Mario Party ones with 60 players in them
-There are more than 25 mini-games and you will probably need about 5-7 hours until you play every one of them at least once
- Progression system is great and getting Kudos (in-game currency) is really easy (you will get some even if you lose in the first round)
-Legendary cosmetic items can be only purchased through ""Crowns"" (Which are acquirable through wins) which means you can not just pay X amount of money for them, you gotta earn them and that makes acquiring them even more rewarding! 
-Finding a new game takes a few seconds

Cons:
-Rarely, servers are unstable (dev team did a great job into fixing them, but still player base is enormous and that is expected for a small indie game to not be prepared for that much players)
-Mini-games with tail do not work well (due to latency issues, sometimes a player can from 5 meters  grab your tail)
-Every player has <Fall Guy XXXX> name and that can be annoying, will update my review if they fix it.
-If you are playing with mouse and keyboard, mouse cursor is visible while controlling the camera
-There are some hackers and if you see some, just leave, it is not worth your time a game that you can not win. 
-Also, there is no report option at the moment

The overall game is great and has the potential to be relevant in the next few years if developers take care of it like they are doing it now

"Ever since Covid-19 started I have been inside since I am a type 1 diabetic so that makes me Immunocompromised. I have tried to pass the time this year by playing video games to take my mind off of how terrible this year has been and how my own mental health has been. Every game I have played I have enjoyed and put a considerable number of hours into them, but so far none have sparked a great amount of joy and get quite redundant. 

Then came Fall Guys. I first heard about it the last day of Beta when i was watching some streams of it on Twitch. Even though I didn't watch a whole lot i knew i had to try it out because it looked soo silly and just plain fun. I picked it up on the last day of preorder and waited for release. The first time launching it and jumping into a game i had actually felt extreme happiness and i was actually having fun. The music, the silly noises, the color, everything just made me have a good feeling and it's been a long time since i've had that.

This game will put a smile on my face and will have me playing it for hours on end just to take a break and hop right back on it. 

When the game launched there were immediate issues that all came down to the servers. They just kept breaking after floods of people were trying to get in. I saw their tweet where something like 1.5 million players in the first 24hours. It was frustrating sure , but I knew they were working on it and for how monumental of a task it was, they managed to fix the problems rather quickly. I have since only encountered sporadic such as getting a server error or just getting kicked out to main menu was queuing with friends. 

This games design, in my opinion is perfect, the games are all . in their own way perfect. They could use a few tweaks just to really nail it down (See Saws im looking at you). The reward system in this game should be an industry standard, the game has you grinding for crowns for those juicy cosmetics.

I will continue to support this game for a long time and cannot wait to see what they have in store for the future.  I want to thank the devs for making this awful year just a whole lot better.",True

At the time of this  review the game has  24 levels (4 categories Race, Survival, Team and Final). Enough variety to make it fun and surprising. Some more modes might be added later.
Your actions are limited to running jumping and grabbing.Each match starts with  60 jellybean contestants .Survive each mode/level and you reach the final race for the crown. 
(Also Don't forget to grab the crown when you jump for it). There are around  5-7 levels  per match depending on the number contestants eliminated each round.

Every round you compete in a different event, sometimes solo sometimes in teams and people are eliminated.  Each game usually lasts anywhere from 4-6 rounds depending on number of players and eliminations.  After every game you earn in game currency and progress for the season.  You can earn new costumes or buy them in the store.  The store updates daily and the first season is 60 days long.

"Here's a short list of aspects that could potentially appeal to me, a prospective player of Fall Guys:

1. bean
2. Aforementioned beans are essentially Minions without being the most annoying fucking things on the planet. For example, I don't have to see Fall Guys merch in every goddamn aisle of every supermarket in the United States
3. lots of hugs, which are hard to come by nowadays
4. splatoon-esque (splatoony?) music
5. all of the minigames radiate strong mario party energy. whether this is good or bad is up to you
6. the only default cosmetic lets you be a furry. whether this is good or bad is up to you
7. getting clocked by a piece of fruit rolling down a hill at mach 3 and haha bean go weeeee
8. getting your tail stolen from 20 feet away because the gordon freeman that grabbed you lives in Madagascar and uses the tail of his pet lemur as an antenna to steal satellite internet
9. watching your friends get clotheslined by obstacles is really funny
10. you can cosplay as a velociraptor, a pigeon, and Alyx from Half Life, among other things
11. it's a feeling unlike any other to push a fellow bean to their doom in the all-consuming purple ooze below
12. gameplay consists of 3 actions; jump, grab, and dive. easy babby game",True

You won't regret playing it, especially with your friends.

"Hey, you remember when games were about having fun? I member. This game members.

Despite some very big flaws, this game is simply just a lot of fun. I would say it's amazing nobody has really done such an obvious premise as a game already but given the game industry, i guess i'm not. Colourful, energetic and most of the time a laugh i think it's certainly worth the price. There's little to say as you pretty much get exactly as advertised, which i guess is another rare thing.

There are some extremely frustrating issues that can really ruin the game and leave a sour taste in your mouth.
1) Laggy players can really mess you up. For example when you're expected to hold onto something, a laggy player can just snipe it out of your hands from about two meters away.
2) Other players can knock you over when you jump. It feels very random and most the time it's a laugh. Sometimes you jump once and then spend the next ten seconds being bounced about to last place while none of your controls respond.
3) Sometimes you just... fall over. It's really rare but if you're in a finale and your character just falls over for absolutely no reason, it's a really souring moment.

It needs more maps as well, so those who are a little cautious about buying this should probably give it some more time. Fix a few bugs, add some more maps and i think this is certainly a game that's worth picking up.",True
"they fall
and they are guys
so the title is pretty honest

"Finally, the cure for coronavirus.",True
"One of the funnest games I've played over the past year. It pretty simple to learn, a game you can jump in and out of, and has a decent variety. This game is more skill based but can have a few RNG elements like team game modes or where you start in certain courses, which I talk about next.

A few critiques I have with this game however are team game modes and the final round, Fall Mountain. I enjoy team modes but the issue here is if you find yourself on the losing team constantly, it gets annoying since you get eliminated where majority of the time it's just your team. Now, for a small critique, Fall Mountain. I think the map is great, it's started to grow on me. Although, It can be a bit unbalanced if you're in the 2nd or 3rd row on start. Not to say you can't win from those starting points, I've won from the back, however if the people in front of you are even slightly good, good luck trying to catch up.

If you don't own this game and are on the edge of buying it, ask yourself, do you want a game you can just turn on and play a round? Are you a fan of shows such as Wipeout or Takeshi's Castle? Do you like games in similar respect to Mario Party minigames? If so, this might be the game for you. All in all, wacky, crazy fun. You'll Fall for this game.",True

"Childish whimsy at it's finest. Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is an amalgamation of the competitive chaos brought by the Battle Royale genre and the waggish, treacherous entropy which ""Party"" games typically adhere. That's right: This game is NOT fair, lacks notable depth yet is centered around (and provides) a competitive experience. The most astonishing discovery? It works. You will not win every game, and that is fine. Because fall guys is a game about having fun. Fun in avoiding the pile of players who failed to traverse that one critical obstacle. Fun in becoming part of said pile, squiggling like a stranded fish flopping waterwards. Fun in marvelling at your brilliant successes and embarrasing downfalls as you try to survive or outwit your opponents in the zany survival rounds. Fun in finally winning that coveted crown as you trounce your rivals for the last time in the finals.

If you like the unruliness of the ""Mario party"" games, the repetitive yet ever fluctative gameplay of mini-game compilations and the elusive certainty of victory in brawlers... This game will provide an experience long un-explored. With a bumping soundtrack, fluid yet ever-so-trippy (pun intended) gameplay and vibrant visuals; Fall guys is a game that will keep you coming back for more.",True

but now....
rng only, mostly raging and even more issues then before.

important updates takes really too long and are bad. cringe how long they needed to made something against the big amount of hackers. literally almost every game a hacker, taking weeks for a solution and then copy&paste the bad fortnite anticheat rofl.
sure is rng a funny factor that can make a game more enjoyable, but seriously what they thought about this big yeetus update? 95% of the levels are now pure rng. its feels like being in a game of russian roulette every round.
the combination of tryharders and big rng will make new players and casual players only suffer and lose mostly at round 1-3. the playerbase get lower from day to day cause of it until only the tryharders will left. you probably will find now already 80% of tryharders in every match you go in. 
from what i see about season 2, it will only get even worse. more rng and team games that will suffer you (until now).
maybe 1-2weeks where playerbase get higher again and then drops again back to this situation what we have now.
i wish i could refund the game cause with 20€ i could buy a game that make at least fun.

The best BR out there imo. Honestly worth the buy if you're looking for a fun game to play during quarantine.,True
"It's a really fun game and I'm glad I was also able to play in the beta, I've allready had loads of fun in this game and you should totally give it a try. It's goofy, you fall a lot, get wacked a lot with objects, balls and fruits, while you race to the finishline with 59 other fall guys all over the place, pushing, trampling, pulling, grabbing, stumbling over and falling ontop of you! Think Takashi's Castle, add some steroids to the mix, don't forget a hint of falling, and you're well on your way to imagening what fall guys is like.

That being said, there is a thing I really don't like, which is the very fact that there are team-games within the episodes, where it simply doesn't matter if you perform right or wrong. 

You could be the best player in the game but if your team let's you down, you'll still lose in those. The oposite is also true, you could be the worst player in the entire game, but if you have a team of good players around you, you'll still win in those. Losing this way AND winning this way, decreases the value and enjoyment of the game greatly in my opinion. 

Aside from this in my opinion very big issue with the game, it's actually quite fun and I expect to play at the very least 100 hours in it easily. If ever the option to not play team games is added or they are flatout removed, I will use it for sure and it'll be a happy day!

All in all, this game is very promising and offers a lot of fun to the mix, this is how battle royals should be done! Fortnite, and all those other battle royals that make me puke, take a hint, take notes, do whatever, I'm not playing you, I'll play Fall Guys instead. I'm loving it!

"* Servers are still broken and I don't think there is any excuse to it. Why are we always accepting games that fix themselves later in their shelve time? If publishers and developers expect me to be ok with it then they should make the game an early access product.
* Progression system is a joke, this is a Devolver published games ladies and gentlemen and they always make fun of and crticize this type of monetizations/microtransactions. Yet here we are progressing to unlock color palettes.
* This game is not FUN. It is just sometimes FUNNY and thats it.
* If you think you will have fun with your friends. Well good luck with that, there is zero benefits to playing with your pals. I would say there is actually very severe disadvantages. If you are down, either you have to watch them play or they have to exit the game. You might be thinking ""that's ok, you lost deal with it"", thats true in some sense but I think watching your friends must get you some percentage of progression and that is not the case.
* There are apparently total of 24 mini-games right now. I think I saw most of them and approximately half are just variants, either team versions or rehashed versions. Currently the level generation is very much broken. You only get a few of them (3-4) in the beginning levels and I don't think that's very much a requirement, the team based games and even some final levels are easily adjustable for starting levels. Starting levels should be the most diverse ones, right now it gets old real quick.
* Most of the levels are unbalanced and obviously not play-tested. Remember the beta? I think that was all the play-testing this game got before launch. There are barely any mechanics your avatar can use and they aren't reliable most of the time, you are just wobbling around through random luck.

How would it be fixed right now?
- The servers obviously.
- Much much more reliable physics and new mechanics, crouch/duck mechanic for example.
- New and different games. Team based games are fun but there is just too much randomness in everything.
- Get rid of the color progression system... This is just not a good color on you Devolver.
- A game mode that gets rid of the elimination system and introduces ranking would lessen the frustration I think. You would rank yourself through 2-3 times the amount of games that is right now and the final games would be best out of three added to the previous ranking.

"The game is okay, but it could be better. There's a lot wrong with it right now, and because of that I cannot justify the $20 price tag.



Pros:

- It's usually fun

- The rounds are fast

- There are some moments that will make you genuinely laugh

- It's a nice casual game to pick up quick for a couple rounds. Would not recommend for long periods of play.



Cons: 

- The game becomes very repetitive very quickly. There's not enough map variety, which eventually leads to losing aggravating you more often than not. Those moments that make you genuinely laugh are scarce. Not a lot of difference happens after you've played over a hundred rounds. Same maps, same stuff happening.

- Grabbing is a mechanic frequently used by players to grief other players. This may be a reason for it, but I see this being used a lot more often in maps that don't require it solely for griefing purposes (like the rotating cylinder one, the slime climb, players on your team grabbing you, or any race map at the very end)

- Some of the maps are really unbalanced and/or have poor mechanics. There's a lot of RNG/chance in some levels.

- There is usually no skill involved with this. It's all random chance with physics, and on race maps it can depend on where you're placed in the starting line-up. This is completely random, even if you've placed first in the race match beforehand.

- 60 player matches can only last as long as the hype before it'll be harder to find players for matches. Even now, most matches only get somewhere between 35 - 50 players. I have seldom seen any with 55+

- Hackers have been popping up.

- Uneven teams is a regular issue in the team maps. Also, more often than not, you will be paired with people who have no idea what they're doing and thus will be inevitably concreted to the losing side. (people getting disconnected or leaving adds to this issue)

- There's a lot of server issues. Sometimes exiting too soon will freeze your game, sometimes while loading the server will drop, sometimes when in a queue it'll say the server is full or something along those lines and it'll kick you back to the main menu (forcing you to re-queue).

- You can only party with up to 4 people, which is upsetting considering this is an up to 60 player game.

"The base game is [b]great.[/b] People complaining about RNG were dropped on their heads as childs, probably. And once these issues get fixed I'll update my review to positive because the literal game of this is fantastic. I still recommend this even though certain things piss me off.

"Fall Guys is so hot right now.

Fall Guys takes party style mini-games, makes them a battle royale of sorts, and then strips everything else away save for a cosmetics shop. No screen names. No mics. No text chat. No matchmaking. Just click, play and enjoy the chaos. It's good clean fun.

There is good variety in the levels and they seem to work for the amount of players. The core of the gameplay is definitely the race levels through obstacles with a certain amount of people qualifying for the next round. But the more inventive survival levels and team levels keep things varied and interesting. Most of the levels overall are fun to play. One or two stick out as lackluster. But more content should arrive with each ""season"" which will hopefully keep things fresh. 

If you're going to get it, now is the time. The player count is absurdly good right now given the gamestyle. There's probably ""elite"" players of this already. There's probably ""hackers"" already. But the crowds are so deep you're going to have fun after a little practice. Basically this is a ""if I can win a game on this, you can win a game on this"". Because yes, I actually won one. Will it be this fun in a year when it's in a bundle for five bucks? Will the players left all be experts that just turn new players into fodder? Will it just be all cheaters and exploits? I can't answer these questions; But I can say it is fun now and the crowds are deep enough to wash away any potential fun ruining players. If you think you'd enjoy the game and want to have fun with the game for certain; Now is the time.

Heck, I play singleplayer games 99.99% of the time and I feel I got my money's worth of fun 4hrs in. Though on the note, it really could use some sort of marathon, bots, or trial singleplayer modes just to get some carefree play in without waiting for a lobby to load.  Recommend for sure.

Edit: After way too many more hours in this; It definitely needs more content/modes for longevity. The first update is a make or break.",True
"Its a fun little game to play with friends but. 

-Sadly it gets repetitive too fast. Within an hour or 2 playing i felt like i played most of the game modes at least 3 times already. Either there aint many or im being extremely unlucky on the selection. 
+This can probably be fixed later down the line if more stages are added.

-Some game modes can straight up put you in a disadvantage sometimes, namely team games where you have 1 less player on your side because of the unfavorable number of players left in the match, also your placement at the start of the match is usually random and some games it's more advantageous to be on the front but you might end up on the back. This can feel unfair/frustrating. 
+The only way i can think to fix this might either be to make sure if the next game mode is gonna be team based that the previous game erases the proper ammount of players or give the extra players some special role outside of the team roles that if they perform well enough they are qualified.

-Items in the shop have a limit time and some of them can only be bought with crowns that you get for winning a match wich isn't common since 60 other players want to win you will have to be the best one. This will take away the chill feel you're probably searching from this game if you really want a specific skin from the shop that is only there for a limited time but can't win enough times to get the currency.
+ A fix would be to increase the price for these items that require crowns but reward crowns to people that reach far in the matches, like if they reach the last phase they get 2 crowns and the winner gets 5 while the new price in the shop reflects this.

-Sometimes it feels like your character will just randomly fall without any real reason but i guess thats why the game is called Fall guys.

If you are gonna get this game remind yourself to not take it too seriously. I'm sure some people really enjoy this but as it is right now i just don't share the same hype.

Edit: After a few weeks the game presents the same issues that i mentioned before(altho it seems the unbalance on teams seems fixed? can't say for sure yet) with an extra one i found.

-Cheaters, a lot of cheaters in this game, such a pitty people feel the need to cheat on a party game like this. +Game requires an anti-cheat system + report system now

- The tail games are terrible, it feels like you can just go AFK and wait for the last 30 secs before actually starting to play and ud get the same result as if u were playing the whole time, besides the bad servers sometimes will make you lose your tail to someone that isnt even near you on your screen leading to frustrating situations.
+ I think the first 30 secs of the match should be as they are now to give the oportunity for people to try get 
a tail, but the last minute if you have a tail you should start getting points per second the longer you have the tail , if you dont have a tail you dont get points, in the end the people with most points win. This would end the frustration of protecting your tail the whole match to then just get destroyed by a laggy grab on you last second.

+ The game is 10x more fun if you are in a voice call with friends playing with you, highly reccomend you to do that instead of playing by yourself. If you don't have friends message me il give you a hug.",False
"First time leaving a review since it's my first time having an urge to do so.

TLDR Do not buy this game until cheater problem is fixed (wont be for a long while).

Cons Before they can actually find a way to solve the cheating issue (on average happens at least 8 games of 10 games) on Fall Guys, this is only going to make players feels frustrated and eventually burnt out. This is a game where if you have 1 cheater out of the potential 60 players, that's already enough to ruin one game - and now has come to a point where having cheater(s) in a game is already the norm. Obviously the current AI bot cheating detecting system is not working at all, and to make matters worse they have made it clear that they are no longer taking in any cheater reports from users.

Pros the game actually got some good game ideas, but again the efficiency and ability to tackle hacker problems is terribly disappointing, despite having so much initial hype and success.",False

"As of writing this it is 9/10/2020 and I have 5.5 hours on record over the last two days

Let me start by saying that I actually love this game. The bean/potato styled characters combined with the goofy ragdoll physics help make this game fun. The mini-games are all pretty fun and I honestly don't really have anything bad to say about any of them. The soundtrack and color palette fits the game perfectly and for such a simple game it's graphics are still pretty good. The characters handle really well, and you can tell a lot of love was put into the game just by playing a few rounds.

Despite all of that, and how much fun I have playing the game alone and with friends I can't reasonably recommend the game as it stands. The core reason behind this is the overwhelming number of cheaters that are currently present in the game is kind of insane. You can play for 3~4 hours like I did yesterday when I bought the game and only get 3 games where there are no cheaters. Tonight's 1-2 hours session averaged the same results, in that time I got 1 game where a player wasn't blatantly cheating. This is about a 1-2 fair game average per hour. When I say players are blatantly cheating I mean they're flying over obstacles from the start of the round, jumping so high they can jump over walls and obstacles, moving so fast that they are completing obstacle courses before the other players in the lobby can even get half way through, teleporting to the crown and winning instantly on crown mountain (the final mini-game to decide the winner), floating above platforms that would otherwise fall or require you to jump something to avoid being eliminated, to as bad as people being able to win in the first round mini-game before any of the 60 player lobby can play and qualify or be eliminated. 

To cap off the review I gotta be honest in that I will continue to play the game. It's just fun, there is no two ways about it. I can not however recommend the game for the above reasons. If you are willing to ignore all of that and just try to have fun with the game, feel free to pick it up. Until the cheaters are reduced you just can't expect to actually have a fair game.",False

This bug has soured up my engagement drastically it needs a patch & fast!

"Fall Guys is a fun game, and it's interesting.  But sadly they have changed the argument.  My daughter and I both love the game, she plays on her account, I play on my acccount and everything was fine.  It's not a particularly great game, but it's still enjoyable for 20 bucks. 

Then Mediatonic changed the deal which is seen here https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1298194813247004672.   Suddenly  Family Sharing has been removed and the developers are claiming it's to stop cheaters.  The problem is that people who bought the game to actually share it with their family is expected to pay for the same game twice.   Or they can just let other users use their Steam account which is against the TOS. 

The thing is removing the family sharing isn't a good solution to dealing with cheaters and removal of Family Sharing is almost never ""temporary"".  They've changed the nature of the game, so I really have a problem with this. 

Steam doesn't want to honor a refund because I have 2.9 hours on record, after two attempts and the removal of a feature I bought this game for.  Either way,  this is not a good sign, and instead of covering it, I'll oddly be covering EA, who seems to be doing everything right on Steam. 

Sorry Fall Guys, you had a chance to make me a fan, and instead pulled this crap.   I am not recommending anyone support this game because there's been enough small issues like this previously, and enough cheaters that people will eventually get sick of it.

I also don't think the game is THAT amazing that I'm willing to forgive this.  Some people will of course, but for me, this is has soured me on the product.

"I wasted $30 on this game. I know this game is popular right now but I honestly don't know why it is. The controls are slippery and extremely frustrating. I have no problem with games that are frustratingly difficult but fair, but this isn't that, it often makes you feel like your loss wasn't even your own fault, but the fault of a game that is poorly designed. I really tried to give this game a chance, but what it really comes down to is that it wasn't fun. It looks like a fun game, it's very colorful and fun to look at. But the overwhelmingly wonky controls make it borderline unplayable. I know that the characters being a little bit wonky and goofy looking is part of the gimmick of the game, but it just doesn't work if the game isn't actually fun to play. Fall Guys really didn't do it for me. There's not much to it and what there is isn't even fun due to the frustrating controls.",False

A few cons and considerations:

This game has been WAY more successful than anticipated so servers have been down a lot so far during launch day, but of course this is launch so that problem with go away as they scale the servers.

A bit buggy in some areas. I think they could have gone for a bit more beta testing.

Not a ton of variety, some of the maps are just bad. However, the devs have confirmed new maps are coming very soon, and they are taking feedback on the current maps to make changes.

Overall, think the few cons are MASSIVELY beat by the absolute fun of the game. I have a feeling this is going to be my ""just chilling"" game for a while going forward.",True
"It's Takeshi's Castle with sentient Mighty Beans, its fine. Buuut;

pengest game ever made,True
"I cannot recommend this game purely because of the large amount of hacking going on. This I'm sure will be sorted eventually but it has been weeks with very little evidence that anything is being done to combat it. No reporting system, and developers actively encouraging people not to report due to unique names not being used to distinguish players. Cheaters have gotten savvy too, with some only switching on their flying hacks, speed hacks whenever the last round occurs, giving them less chance of being booted out by a collaborative team effort in the team games.

This game is fun. It has a surprising amount of strategy and depth below it's bubbly, colourful surface. Some of the games are not up to scratch, with latency issues affecting tail grabbing games and a late round game called tiptoe which has not been particularly well thought out. The games also do get repetitive with it's current pool not large enough to attract long term interest but with season 2 out shortly, this will receive a well timed boost.

This game has the potential to be excellent but in it's current state is probably not worth it.",False
kids noclipping fly hacking just to ruin it for everyone and there is no report system games not complete at all but the game modes/music/graphic/mechanics feel good and fun.,False
"[h1]My honest opinion:[/h1]
I have been looking forward to this game for months, but since I bought it I regret it. In this game you play to win from a group of 60 players (Battle Royale-ish). 9/10 Games you will be matched with one or more cheaters. They fly around the world to win. Winning gives in-game currency which makes it interesting for a lot of players to download hacks.

I quite often make it to the final round! However due to this large amount of cheaters the chance to actually win the game is close to 0%. It's not that I can't stand my loss, but [b]it's not fun to have no chance to win[/b].

Now that the developer has cashed in, he has decided it's the perfect moment to take a two-week vacation despite these huge problems. So it will certainly not be playable in the coming days. I think that's unfair for all of the players that payed 20 euro's, which is quite a price for such a simple game.

The concept is certainly nice, but the implementation is very bad thanks to the developers' poor motivation.

I do not recommend playing this game until major changes take place. I'm sorry to bring you this sad news.

"[h1] Review: [/h1]

TL; DR: See the conclusion

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is one of the most addicting and fun gaming experiences so far this year, at least for me. The concept of game is basically if Takeshi's Castle and Wipeout had a baby, and that baby grew up and did acid. The goal is simple: get qualified in each round and get a win in the final round. But simple does not mean easy, as 59 other people (if the match is completely full) is hunting for the same goal. The game can be intense when you reach your first final round.

Most of the 25 or so minigames available here is good enough for me to play repetitively. However, some minigames can prove to be frustrating. This is especially true in team-based games, where you can get eliminated by being in a team despite you playing really well. I hope in the future they add a separate playlist that does not feature team games. Also, the game's servers, for now, can be very unstable due to the high number of players beyond servers' capacity. Expect some connection failures and some server downtime before purchasing this game. I recommend checking out the game's Discord server or Twitter account to check servers' status.

The progression system of this game is simple. In each season, there is a season pass-style progression system with 40 tiers (called as ""fame(s)"" in-game) to grind for. However, it can only be progressed by playing the game, not by using real money to shortcut your way through. In the pass, there are season-exclusive cosmetics, Kudos (in-game currency that can be earned by playing or bought with real money), and Crowns (exclusive currency you get by winning the final round). 

The customization of this game is great. You can customize your bean-like character's upper and lower body in many ways, whether it be a chicken, a dinosaur, an astronaut, a hamburger, or even some weird hybrid between many available archetypes. You can also customize your character's color, color pattern, and faceplate. There's also emotes you can use and celebratory animations you can show off when you win the game. 

Now, most of the cosmetics available is in the store, which uses a time rotation system for its items similar to Fortnite and Rocket League. Lower rarity items change daily, whilst more exclusive ones change once every few days. Some ""featured"" items in the store can only be earned by using Crowns, which can take a considerable amount of time to grind and can be frustrating for many players who cannot secure a win in the final round. For example, the upper body and lower body cosmetics of Alyx from Half-Life: Alyx cost 5 Crowns each and are in rotation for only 3 days. I think that these items should be purchasable using Kudos or even a mixed-currency system where you can trade in, for instance, 2 Crowns and 9,000 Kudos to get one Alyx item. This should help shift the mindset of the player to focus on having fun instead of competing for Crowns all the time to the point of frustration.

"Nope. Too many hackers and their laughable support page I had to get to to attempt to report someone. In my less than 3 hours, I encountered 3 hackers and there is no in-game or out of the game way to report people as far as I'm aware. Their response is something along the lines of : Our system will have caught them so no need to report them! Yeah, like a) has that ever stopped someone in the history of video games and b) highly doubt it, bigger higher stakes games with millions more invested into anti-cheat can't pick up this stuff, no way a first-time indie dev is picking this up. The fact that to even see that response you have to jump through the hoop of going into the menu, clicking support, a separate page coming up, then you have to find the section on cheaters just for them to be like ""lol, we gotem"" nope nope nope. The game itself is fun, but such a tone-deaf response to such a huge issue. Also, cramming tons of microtransactions into a $20 game, like wtf. Also, the fact you can't even have your own name is mind-boggling in a game that seems to emphasize customizability and creativity, just to be named Fall Guy #169409234502243598 is mind-boggling. I have done some research and can't find a clear reason as to why this is the case, but according to some sources it's to ""protect streamers"". If that's the case that's absolutely absurd.

The team modes are not fun most of the times cus it feels like everything is agasint you in some of them for instance sometimes other fallguys have cast iron plates in their soft bean head that can launch a football straight in to your net but when you do it you get sent to the ICU.

Solid idea, horrible execution.
I genuinely like the concept and basic gist of the game, and if the devs are gonna address the issues the game has, I would absolutely recommend it.

Here's an incomplete list of serious problems this game has as of review writing:
- Minigame variety has been exhausted after about 2-3 hours already. There's maybe a bit more than a dozen games, and that is counting duplicates for different parkour levels.
- Egg Scramble and Rock n Roll are absolutely horrible and are here to ruin your day. Especially annoyed at Egg Scramble, this concept has been tried and failed before (just one example, Tower Unite: Planet Panic which was taken down by their devs)
- Some of the other minigames are also bad enough to offset the few genuinely good ones down into oblivion.
- Not sanitizing user names and ""fixing"" it by disabling user names altogether. Come on, guys.
- Very unstable servers (though, I guess cause of the huge player amount on launch, that's excusable.)

If the most egregious games get reworked, and a significant amount of minigames gets added instead of the already present microtransactions, I would be more positive about this game.

Furthermore, it also breaks the support for Ultrawide Monitors as this required the modification of a configuration file and such modifications are not permitted by the new anticheat.  This mandatory patch has considerably lowered the value of the game to me, and I do not wish to support developers that believe they can simply worsen the player experience post-launch.  UPDATE: Steam denied me a refund for the game despite the above changes, so now I am stuck with a game that no longer runs properly on my monitor, nor can I use it on my primary OS partition.

Simple and vibrant graphics, a nice variety of maps to start with, easy to pick up game mechanics - Fall Guys is certainly a blast at time of launch! Thankfully, the devs seem to be dedicated to releasing heaps more modes, cosmetics, and features in the future, so I don't think the player base will die out any time soon.

- Trash servers: servers down too often / lose connection to the server and you can't get into next round or lose all your rewards at the end of the game (sometimes you can't even get your compensation).
- Hackers: not many people cheat in this game BUT if there is ONLY ONE cheater in a game, the rest of players (around 50) will NOT HAVE FUN in the next 10 minutes unless they quit and rejoin a game with no hackers.

봇없이 50명 이상의 플레이어를 꾸준히 채워가며 게임이 돌아간다는게 굉장히 인상적이었다. 너무나도 많은 겜들이 좋은 게임성을 가지고 있음에도 불구하고, 서버를 계속 유지할 만큼 플레이어를 유지를 못해서 망해간 것을 고려해본다면, 이 겜은 많은 찬사를 받을 가치가 있고 게임 개발자들에게 훌륭한 예로 남아야한다고 생각한다. 이 겜은 스팀 게임 역사상 꽤 인상적인 순간으로 기억될 것이다.",True

Hackers are frequent, team games are absolutely miserable, the cosmetic shop feels awful because everything worth unlocking is on a timer, and the lag results in levels like the tail game being an inconsistent and infuriating mess.

This could be fantastic with some updates, assuming they actually listen to criticism and the game isn't dead at that point.",False

"With many hours of playing the beta and now enjoying the main game its a fun experience with some concerns, 
Temporarily this game is having some technical issues so i woudln't recommend it, i would recommend it once these issues are fixed. 

Good things -  its a fun time with fresh game play,  a pleasing aesthetic, great graphics and can provide entertainment with friends on stream or just on your own for hours. 
Concerns -  micro-transactions: During the beta none of this information was really shown but after looking at the shop some of the cosmetics seems pretty expensive they do include a free battle pass available at launch which may keep most players content though it could be seen as exploitative given the  colourful and child friendly nature of the game. 

Some game modes and gameplay can be frustrating: this isn't really a competitive game so don't expect that but some team based game modes can be frustrating as you feel helpless when your team is really bad. leaving myself feeling like there's nothing i can do as a game of football end 10-1 in the enemies favour but my team pushes it toward our goal etc.

"This is one of those rare cases where Steam reviews fail to let me fully answer the question ""Would you recommend this game to other players?"" If I had the option, it would be more of a ""Ehhhh...""

I like [i]Fall Guys[/i]. It's a light-hearted, Total: Wipeout type battle royale that we haven't seen much of before - and it's a fun idea, I really enjoy that part of it - solo or with friends. 

However, there are certain problems with this game that annoy me to no end. The ragdoll physics need some changes, I think. One of the problems with this being a light-hearted, ""you're a jellybean how cute"" video game is that the physics go alongside with the jolly, not serious playstyle which I didn't have any problems with at first. However, because this is a battle royale and only one player can win, you [i]really[/i] want to win, and therefore learning the mechanics that shape how you interact with your character and how your character interacts with others is a really important thing to do. But BECAUSE this game is so unpredictable, it's REALLY hard to do that.

Take the infamous See Saw for example. As you're jumping from one see saw to the next, your foot could get caught by a nearby player, and now - because of the way the physics works - you ragdoll for a few seconds and fall off. This is really infuriating, because you had no choice - hell, you may have been even actively avoiding this exact scenario - but it will still happen anyway. This is funny at first, but because you're trying to win, the frustration builds up. Sometimes I'll just ragdoll for no reason! I'm just walking, I press A and then I do a pathetic flimsy jump because ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

Not only this, but the way grabbing works in minigames revolving around that exact feature, like Tail Tag or Royal Fumble, is really inconsistent. I could be next to someone with a tail and press the right trigger and it would not register, but while I'm ahead of everyone by 2 or 3 jellybeans, someone could press the right trigger and steal my tail somehow.

Also worth mentioning I get randomly disconnected from the server during some games, which is really annoying - especially if I'm doing well.

All of these features are things that CAN improve over time, if the developers make the right calls. Meanwhile, I'd wait for it to go on sale because £15 is a bit much for a game that isn't fully polished - plus, by the time it goes on sale, a bunch of these problems may be fixed.",False

However, as criticised by many, the mix of solo and team games makes the game unbalanced and, ultimately, it is only the final round that matters. Any round before that may be fully determined by luck instead of skill considering a randomly chosen team is all you get. Additionally, teams don't tend to be divided evenly, making the game even less balanced.

I came for a knockoff Takeshi's Castle experience, instead I got a sometimes non-functioning grief fest. Honestly, ""grabbing"" shouldn't even be a mechanic in this game, all it does is encourage griefling, as it screws up not just the grabbee, but the grabber as well.

"Awesome game. Of course, like most modern games - the servers weren't ready for the load. Big deal. Great publisher, great developers, great game. Simple as that. The game modes are awesome, the game play is awesome, and once the servers are squared away, it too; will be awesome.

Edit: After some time with the game, I still like it - but I definitely have some gripes. 

1) Team levels - My success should not be reliant on the ability of randoms. This really sucks the fun out of the game.

2) Collisions - While I understand they're necessary, having to fight through a tiny door way requires no skill, which means it's all up to chance if you're one of the few who slip through quickly or not. 

3) The lack of skill required - There are only 3 moves. Running, jumping, and diving. Diving is useless in 90% of cases, and in most - simply slows you down. There should be some abilities that are skill based to help separate the good players from the ones who just got lucky (See points 1 and 2). A sprint that only works for a short period of time, so it's necessary to only use it when you feel it'll really help. A roll saver (Some way to keep momentum when you dive, perhaps timing a key/button press at the right moment to continue your movement without being stuck in the ""getting up"" animation. 

4) Poor map ideas - The Seesaw map is a good example of this. The only way to complete this map is with the cooperation of the people you're trying to beat. Why design a map like this? If you spend time fighting on trying to get the seesaw to go your way, but the other guys are on the other end, no one progresses. And there are no alternative routes or paths for more skilled players, so you're stuck; once again, relying on the opposing players. 

These 4 issues, are in my opinion, need to be fixed to create a game that truly feels fun, and allows skilled players to separate themselves from the lucky ones. Currently, most of the rounds are being left up to chance, which shouldn't be the case in a competitive style game. 

Hopefully, these issues will be addressed in some form or another. Aside from those (which, I agree; are quite substantial), it really is a cute, fun game to play which you could easily sink hours into.",True
"The game has a cool concept, it's great for playing casually with your friends and get a good laugh, but it currently has some issues which don't make it that enjoyable:
- you never know if someone is truly where you see him because there is some desync, this often translates into someone else winning even though you saw them being behind you. This is also inconvenient in modes such as tail grab where you can't accurately predict when to grab or where to go.
- there are a lot of cheaters, in 7/10 games I encounter someone moving really fast or flying. It's really frustrating to try your best and see how someone just floats in the air and gets the win.
- lack of consistency - you never know what will happen when you touch someone, sometimes you push him, sometimes it throws you off, sometimes nothing happens, etc.
- team games are RNG based. You're either lucky and your team is good or you aren't lucky and the other teams bully you.

All in all I think the price is too much for what the game offers, not worth buying it unless on a sale.",False

"First and foremost,

I will start this review out with what most people, who have had a negative experience with Fall Guys, have said. This game has a massive problem with cheaters. It is virtually impossible to obtain a win. This has drove me away from the game for a while, but today I decided to finally purchase it, seeing that they are working on installing a new anti-cheat system. I have 37 minutes on record and from what I can tell you, do not buy this game until further notice. There are still plenty of cheaters present, and to make things worse, I cannot even load into a game. I get stuck in a constant loading screen loop every single time. For my first two games, it worked totally fine with no issue, but now I cannot load in at all. I will be refunding this game within the next hour. It's almost as if the developers did not anticipate the game becoming as popular as it is. I hope they do fix this game, because it has some massive potential, but who knows. I mean, the main developer is on a week long vacation for god's sake.

"Game no longer works on linux due to implementation of Epic's Easy Anti Cheat in today's September 15 Big Yeetus update.

EAC does not work with Play on Linux (proton), has not for a long time, and appears there are no plans to make it do so.

Until Valve and Epic get their ♥♥♥♥ together, or until Fall Guys developers release a native linux port this game will not run on linux.

Additionally, refunds are *not* being offered for this. Rocket League did this exact thing and allowed users to refund. It is unacceptable that I can't be refunded $25 for my 5 hours of play after today's update makes it unplayable on my operating system.

Linux accounts for close to 1% of steams usage. For fall guys to drop linux support, means somewhere between 70,000 - 100,000 affected linux gamers. Fall guys owes linux gamers up to $2,500,000 in revenue total if they would honour a responsible refund policy.

This game in its description should note it will NOT work on linux (even if you tweak it yourself or use proton!) and refunds SHOULD be offered to linux users, as their purchased copies of the game has essentially been taken from them.",False

"I started loving this game, but now I’ve really soured on it. I’ve played, maybe a hundred rounds, and have won a handful. I play it on steam so I can do anything else during matchmaking.

Now, I don’t maximize the game anymore during a lot of the gameplay. The memory game, I don’t need to be there for the first 10 seconds.

The game where you need to keep your tail (not the team or the final game), the only portion that matters is the last 20 seconds.

The game where you dodge the walls coming by before it gets ‘harder’

I find myself, now, realizing that I would rather be doing anything else than playing most of these mini games anymore.

I love, love, love the races and all of the finals, but everything else is an RNG chore.

The ending celebration screen is such a slog every time I lose for a dumb reason and it does make me frustrated.

This is really just a post for people on the fence. This is a cute, RNG game with no learning curve. There’s things you can do to help succeed, sure, but that’s not the point. This is a game where you and your kids are on the same level, or you and your non-gaming significant other/friends are all on the same level. Anyone can win, and that’s the point, and that’s fine.

When I bought it, I assumed that skill would play some role in this game and it really doesn’t at the end of the day so, now, I am finished playing it.

- Anti-cheat has been added and not seen a cheater since, have fun everyone!


Edit: 13/08/20

- The dev's have made the servers very stable, not been disconnected for 3 days now so good the server issue is fixed


Edit: 9/8/2020

- Servers work however you will experience many ""you have been disconnected"" messages multiple times, making you lose out on any kudos/exp you would of earned

When the servers are up, the game runs well but the grab mechanic will often jedi-force you back due to laggers not near you.",True

On top of that, the team games that people complain about have really grown on me. Yes, you can get randomly blown out, and losing when it's out of your control sucks, but you can actually affect the outcome quite and bit, and winning because you pulled something off feels amazing.

"Not worth €20.

Game is too random, jumping physics are weird, confusing maps, people are toxic. Some people can jump over while your character gets stuck despite doing the same. If you're unlucky and end up last you might as well give up, as there is no way to catch up. Team games are just awful. Grabbing mechanic sucks, and you can't do anything when you've grabbed someone. Why not be able to throw them?

Playing with friends feels pointless as there is no teamplay, and everyone looks so similar. Even in a big lobby it feels like you're playing alone. The name system is incredibly awful, I understand not wanting profane names, but there are way better solutions to that.

Game looks nice and has decent music. Animation is good. Love the menus, but a bit too simplistic at times. Controls are wack. Physics feel inconsitent and sluggish. Very few customisation options right off the bat. The store only updating once a day and the featured items are boring. And the in-game currency is overpriced ala Valorant. Server issues leading to everyone getting kicked mid-game, which just sucks. Latency is also a big issue in the tail game.

"This was a great game, until they broke it today. With their new update, yes, they're gotten rid of the cheaters, but they've gotten rid of a bunch of others caught in the crossfire, too. Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat software is refusing to let some retain connection to the game for more than a few seconds, shutting down if there are any other tabs in the background, and straight up refusing to launch for some players. Don't believe me? Check out the discussions page for the game here on Steam, full of people complaining about how they can't play the game they paid for.

Beyond this, asking for help is pointless. All you'll get back are swarms of people with beans for brains calling you a cheater, or saying that you've ""Got your money's worth"". Contacting Mediatonic is useless as well, as their Twitter support page refuses to respond due to too many requests for help. Putting in a ticket on their website won't work either, you just get told to uninstall and reinstall. I've done that. Three times. Nothing works. I can't even get a refund because I've played 26 hours.

Basically, the game I and many others paid for is being held hostage. Their crappy anti-cheat software takes a flamethrower to anyone who has Linux instead of Windows, and just crushes anyone else whose antivirus is ""not up to date"" (I checked, it's updated). I can't get my money back, and I can't play the game, despite the fact that I've done nothing wrong.

Fall Guys is one of those games that doesnt take itself too seriously and just strives for fun. It absolutely nails that goal. The game is always a blast to play and you never know what crazy moment is about to happen next regardless of how many times you may have played the minigames. The game is only $20 and one of the few BR's out there that aim for having a fun experience rather than the competitive scene. These developers deserve every penny and you owe it to yourself to try this game out!,True
"It's well made, but gets stale very quick, most minigames feel the same and there's few of them. It's not a party game as it is described. Essentially, it's a solo game. This is the biggest turnoff for me. Played some games with a friend and although we had some fun, didn't feel like we were playing together.

The dev team still isn't doing enough, hackers are rampant in this game and take all the joy of playing away.

Honestly until the dev team can kick a hacker out of a game after a round, (I mean they fly around and finish a map in seconds or float in the air for 20 seconds at a time) I don't recommend picking this up.",False

Each match is a short 5-10 minute burst so it doesn't feel like you've put so much time into it, nothing is locked behind MTX(kudos packs and DLC skins are optional) and the Mediatonic crew are really making beneficial changes when and where they can.

The design, colors, and concept are all refreshing. The free battle pass and store feel fair and pro-consumer as you're able to earn the currencies in-game. Some game mechanics need altering, need more matchmaking game-modes, and more features for party play need implementation. However, if Mediatonic can stay on top of releasing new content, features, and preventing any cheating, they're going to secure the jelly-bean crown without a problem. 

Ps: No-one expected such a large amount of players day one. Give them some time to fix the server issues!",True

"Decent game (when playing with friends and being able to shitpost together over a voice call). Definitely not worth the full price. Things that would be needed for me to say this game is worth full price:

1) Get better servers: There have been plenty of times when I would join a game with my friends, only for one of them to say ""Wait, why am I back on the party screen?"" because the game kicked them.
2) Do better about cheaters: The game has a rampant cheating problem, with flyers zipping all over the place. Especially bad on the seesaw map, when the flyers can just push up one end to make it impossible for people to get across, or hex-a-gone, where they can just float in place and wait for everyone to drop.
3) Get rid of team games. There is literally nothing I hate more than having a good time with door dash, slime mountain, and other racing games, only to see that the next game is a team one. They're all bad. Soccer, eggs, tails, rolling the ball. All bad.
4) Get rid of tail games and the fruit game: The tail games just suck in general. The fruit game (perfect match?) is bad because barely anyone gets eliminated.
5) Less Fall Mountain: There are 4 ""final round"" games, as far as I know. There is a tail one, which is bad already because tails. There is hex-a-gone, which I got to play once and jump showdown, which I got to play twice. Literally every other time it has been Fall Mountain. Fall Mountain needs to happen less.
6) More games in general: I know season 2 is coming. Hopefully that will have more games, and none of those games will involve teams. If Season 2 only comes with 1 or 2 new games, though, I'll be disappointed, and I'll still say ""not worth the full price.""

Wait for a sale.",False
"[b] ** DESPITE MY THUMBS UP I DO HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THIS GAME ** [/b]

TL;DR - This game is fun but I hope they add more content soon or it will get old

I downloaded this game as soon as it launched and have been playing it with a couple friends for about 4 hours now. I don't care what anyone says, this game is a [i] deathmatch. [/i] I find it very competitive and a lot of fun when you play with friends and go from cheering them on to facing them in the final round.

Here are my thoughts:

[b][u] PROS [/u][/b]
- Simple gameplay that's easy to learn, hard to master
- Nice customisation; most of the outfits are well designed, [i] colours ill come back to [/i]
- Fun obstacle courses, some minigames are aight
- Hugs :)

 [b][u] CONS [/u][/b]
- Team games suck ass, especially ones late into the episode
- Some features feel irrelevant (emotes, grabbing)
- Lack of maps and any form of map choice (lots of the same maps/games being played each episode)

Here are some of my ideas:
[b] - DITCH TEAM GAMES [/b] or make it so they are only played at the start of episodes. This will mean that if someone loses a chance at the last round, it's their own fault and not some AFK/daft player on their team
[b] - LET US CHOOSE OUR OWN COLOUR SCHEMES [/b] for customisation. [strike] or don't, it's your game, I don't feel that strongly about this point [/strike] 
[b] - ADD SOME MORE OBSTACLE MAPS, [/b] I kind of assumed they're gonna add more maps over time but I started having repeats very early on which is a bummer because the different maps are really fun
[b] - ADD A MAP VOTING SYSTEM, [/b] it would be such a cool thing to have because not only would it prevent repeats but it would allow us to not play team matches or mini-games that are utter trash
[b] - DO SOMETHING MORE WITH GRABBING, [/b] it's only purpose in this game is to fuck with people and ruin their lives. If that's the intended purpose then you are evil but I can learn to forgive
[b] - **ADD A SECOND CHANCE FUNCTION**, [/b] on the elimination screen, there are these pegs that the fall guys fall into, and it's set up just like a Pachinko machine. Imagine if you had a chance to land into a slot that put you back into the game or gave you a little extra currency. Would make going out from a team game a lot more bearable. Just a fun idea
[b] - LET US MOVE AROUND MORE [/b] after the rounds. Wouldn't it be neat if instead of doing dumb poses in the elimination boxes we could ragdoll around as we're shot from them? Would be the perfect time to use [i] **EMOTES** [/i] as well, since they're so rarely used

That's my two cents, hope it helps inform you when buying the game and maybe help Devolver make some cool changes :)",True

"Nice game, although it won't be funny until something is done to ban all the cheaters. It hasn't got any anti-cheat software implemented (at least one that works), and you can't even report cheaters, which you always know who they are, because of what I already wrote they don't even have to hide, and it's obvious when you see chars flying from start to the finish line in 2 seconds....",False

I'd gladly change my review when the devs figure out a solution. I don't even understand why you would want to cheat in this baby game anyway.",False
"Very recommended, the best game since early-days Rocket League to drop in and have a few games of if you're on your own and just need some on-the-spot fun with no hassle, and it's one of the best games full stop if you're playing with a group of friends. It's niche, it doesn't have the pressure of other ""competitive"" titles to be good. It's Takeshi's Castle with chunky runner beans. What more could you want. There's a few things though to keep in mind to help you decide whether this is the game for you.

Is There Content?
At the moment, there's a good handful of maps that up to 60 players will compete on in rounds. There's enough in there to keep one person entertained for a while, however if you're rinsing the game and hitting the max season pass level within a week or so (bearing in mind later levels do take a while though), then you -might- find yourself wanting a bit more. This shouldn't be a problem when it comes to season 2 in a months time, and concurrent after that. All-in-all, it should be content peachy. 

Is it Fun to Win?
Yes, but only if you're not focusing too hard on it. This game was not made to be an e-sport in mind. It's meant to have a much greater element of luck and casual play. Unfortunately if you're very competitive and feel particularly angered by not winning every game, then you may need to stay away. Though that being said if you wanted to try it and use it to gauge your saltiness levels so you can manage them, this title serves as probably one of the better benchmarks out there.

But There are Problem's with Hackers?
If you've seen the discussion boards and some of the reviews. Yes there are undeniably issues with ""hackers"" being a freshly released title by a comparatively smaller company than any AAA developers. Mileage may vary on how often you come across them and I haven't seen them in most of my games. That being said, Three things to keep in mind

1) MediaTonic -do- care about the issue and are resolving it. Ignore anyone who say that they don't care because ""they have all of our money"". Any developer looking to make a game sustainable will -always- be focusing down on cheaters as it will affect their bottom line immensely. A popular live-service game that lasts more than a year will make -far- more money than initial sales revenue. Why would anyone with a brain forgo that? Furthermore, ignore people say ""nothing is being done"". Believe me, if cheaters were being left alone from day 1 there's be a lot more than a paltry 3% that have earned the 7 crown achievement. There'd be no need for hacks to be ""updated"" as often as they apparently do... and the family share disabling is also an unfortunate necessity, but also proof MT are taking active steps.

2) It's early season 1, like any other game of this ilk it would be damning to the games popularity if it WASN'T having early problems with cheaters. (Rocket League and Dead by Daylight come to mind here). There is no magic bullet that will eliminate all hackers from day 1 and keep clean for the rest of time. Heck, GTA online still has the chance a random fighter jet will spawn into your apartment from a hacker and that's been out seven years, from a company that has unlimited resources, server space, and experience by comparison. Over time, shores of defences will be put up that make cheating much rarer. Patience is a virtue.

3) With the game's current flow, it takes no time to exit a game with a cheater especially if discovered in round 1 and jump into another game. Heck there's a decent chance the cheater will get eliminated via a team game or through their own incompetence if you do decide to stick on. 

As I said, mileage may vary, and the game should progress in the next month in terms of its negative issues. But the fun factor should override all that as is. If you're uncertain about purchase, and you're still worried about the cheating. I recommend setting a timer for an hour and half and if you're one of the unlucky few that get cheaters nearly every time, refund, and maybe give it another go a year down the line.",True
This game is a lot of mindless fun with friends and has a fun customisation  system that keeps you coming back day after day.,True
"Fall Guys is a colourful and fun game with cute animations.
However, don't be fooled by its cute appearance - it's hard work to win matches. In fact, it can be very difficult to make it past a few rounds.
The game is easy to play, but hard to win.

Each game consists of a number of rounds.
You start off with a lot of players in the first round, but a bunch of the players who come last are then eliminated. Same with the second round, and so on.
At the time of writing this review, I haven't yet won a 4th round (*insert sad music here*).

Fall Guys is a lot of fun, and you can join a match in a group of friends, so that makes it even better.
Give it a go - you won't be sorry (until you lose too many rounds, that is).

"Goofy battle royale without the normal shootyboy nonsense of most of them.  This is you taking your silly jellybean character through multiple mini-games in the vain of stuff like Takeshi's Castle or Wipe Out.  Some of them are obstacle courses, others are team-based variations of several things like soccer/football or trying to grab a tail off another player, or not be 'infected' in another team game.

The game is goofy fun right now with lots of silly cosmetics to buy on a rotation system.

Only real negatives I have to consider are:
-Latency in Tag/Grab games can cause frustration
-Diversity of Minigames is good for launch but definitely needs to be a quick focus of upcoming added content.

Other than that, when the gimmick or appeal of the game wears out and you've tried every game there's not much more to it.

"The game is great, the game show vibe it gives off is cool, but my main gripe is the lack of games. There are barely any and most of the time you'll end up feeling bored after an hour of playing, maybe even less. the developers will probably add content, but right now there isn't much to do. I suggest you play it if you want a few hours of fun.",True
"Ignore the clowns review bombing this just because of bad servers. The Game itself is fun and I highly recommend it.
The variation in game modes, combined with the randomness of each game, make for an experience that is rarely repetitive.
If you are looking for a fun experience that you don't need to put many hours into (though you can if you wish), you will probably enjoy this experience.

If you're a solo player you may see more action, but the game can get repetitive and frustrating if you just care to win (or troll).

Needs a few important things to make it shine.
- Better servers. We're getting a lot of disconnects. Maybe even some bots to fill in the blanks faster in order to reduce the loading time between matches..
- Valve Anti Cheat support, VAC ban the cheaters (and in turn family shared cheaters)
- Better party/team support. You can't really tell whether anyone from ""your team"" is still in the running unless you're in voice chat. Such as party nametags or indicators.

And some minor things.
- Extra music tracks.
- More skins and color variations to better customize your character. (perhaps an accessory slot)
- More levels added to the rotation.",True

Also some new stuff was added, definitely would recommend.",True
"+ Advantages :
- A fresh and general public battle royale
- Various levels
- A clear gameplay perfectly in tune
- Lots of customization options
- The general atmosphere, super festive

- Drawbacks :
- We would have liked more content at launch
- Things to review for online games
- Some small technical issues

Summary : Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a little bubble of happiness in a genre - battle royale - that easily boils down to gun battles. With its concept inspired by well-known TV shows, the title proves that large-scale online games can also be wacky and mainstream. But Fall Guys is not just a series of fun races, and is well enough thought out to offer a variety of situations ( both in a team and solo, where you will sometimes have to survive rather than reach a finish line ) who have the good taste to not frustrate the player in the home stretch. As it stands, we still regret a lack of content (about twenty levels divided into four categories) which becomes quite obvious when the same tests come back repeatedly. But this is only the beginning for Fall Guys whose content, via a season system, will eventually be fleshed out. And the simple fact of having tasted it makes you want to see more. The result is a good game, which will undoubtedly become very good with the arrival of new challenges and the correction of small technical problems.

"If you enjoyed the mini games in the Team Fortress 2 Halloween seasonal updates or Mario party buy this game now.
I'm 39 years old yet this game gives me the giggles like I'm 12 again. 

28 mini games, 60 people knockout. It has a touch of RNG, skill, some more RNG & most importantly some seriously funny moments  (both in victory, but more so when you have an epic failure) and even cosmetics to keep the Generation z boys and girls happy.

9/10

Needs a a lot more game modes to make it last though in the long run.

To be frank, I did not know much about this game when I got into it a week ago. I don't follow streamers and haven't seen anyone play it before. I got it because it looked fun and couple of my friends had it. Wisest 20€ I've spent on this platform. Fall Guys is memory from the past, times when games on general used to be more fun. I don't think I've enjoyed a multiplayer game this much in years. It's not that serious or competitive, which I think is it's other achievement. I genuinely hope it stays that way. Apart from the core 60-player matches filled with diverse and fun levels, the game has great customization, community and potential for future. Not to forget it's audio-visual side, it needs some praise as well. I don't see any negatives here, some minor inconveniences have been the issues with cheaters and the somewhat problematic network side. I don't see them being in the way of the fun however.

"So, is Fall Guys fun and enjoyable? Absolutely not. This game is infuriating in every way. It's somewhat fun when everything goes your way and you win and infuriating the rest of the time. A good game should be fun even when you lose but there's nothing fun about getting hit by something because you got caught up in an avalanche of other players only to end up getting bounced around all over and lose the match. 

I can usually tell within the first 5 or so seconds if I'm going to win the match. Either you're in the front and going to win or something held you back and you're out of luck. 

Don't bother.",False
"fell over
10/10",True
"As of right now I just can not recommend this game, the reasons being:

[h1] Servers unstable [/h1]
  [i] As of right now the servers are extremely unstable, even with the fixes implemented since launch. Are they better than launch day? Yes, massively. Do you still get disconnected every other game? most of the time, yes.

[b] Will this be fixed? [/b] Of course, either servers will be upgraded or more likely fewer people will be playing and server stability will be at a playable level.[/i]

[h1] Hacking [/h1]
  [i] Around 40 - 50% of the games I've played recently have had some sort of hacking in them, be this speed hacking, flying or just straight up teleportation to the end of the level. You can not win against these people and makes the game pointless. They also had to turn off names in game and give everyone a generic ""Fall Guy #1234"" name due to being able to insert HTML code into the game.

[b] Will this be fixed? [/b] To a degree, yes. Pretty much all games suffer from some sort of hacking, And while they'll surely patch the current hacks, I fear there will be new ones created to replace them. Also the game has NO sort of report system, so if someone is hacking, then tough.[/i]

[h1] Limited game modes [/h1]
  [i] After a day of playing this, you will have played all the game modes, then you play them on repeat, over, and over, and over, and over. The game goes from fun to repetitive very quickly. Then there's the team modes, where you have to hope that the rest of the people you are teaming with are any good, and you may fail through no fault of your own. These team games are forced, you have no choice to play them or not.

[b] Will this be fixed? [/b] More than likely, they'll for sure add new maps, but then the same issue will appear after a while. They need to introduce some sort of procedural map generation. They also need to make team games optional.[/i]

I'll update this review over time, but until these three main issues are resolved I'd wait until you can get the game on sale.",False
"This is really just all around pure fun.
If you're losing it's fun, because you might fall off in a funny way, if you're winning it's fun, and if you're playing with friends, you'll laugh together like you've never laughed before.

They're already working hard on fixing the server issues, and once that is resolved, there's so much potential as well, with more maps, more costumes, etc.

Probably the best thing that has happened in 2020 honestly but, I digress, The mini games in the gameshow are simple and easy for anyone to pick up with their endearing and colorful maps as well as the inviting music. The character customization gives you something to look forward to as you win crowns and receive kudos for playing often. The party play is my favorite because there is just something about trying to take on the challenges with your peeps and cheering them on when you don't qualify. There is so much that they can do with this game and I am excited to see what they have in store.",True

At this moment in time I can't give this a positive review. However only for one reason which is the terrible servers. The servers are constantly up/down/up/down. When this game actually works it's fantastic fun but at the moment just a cash grab from the devs,False

"As a kid, I always fuckin' adored Takeshi's Castle and those manic, crazy types of game shows that could just get so hectic and leave me in absolute tears of laughter. Finding out about this game was such a surprise too, since I didn't even give it a first glance when it released.

So when I actually saw gameplay of this game from Markiplier, I immediately realised how much I loved and required this game, and getting to play it is just as fun as expected.

As people have said, yes, it could do with a bit more variation in it's levels and maybe even so mix ups in how to play, just to really keep things interesting, but this is the start of something I can tell will grow to become one of the most fun and just enjoyable games of 2020.

"Great game, sets the bar for how betas should be released and handled, amazing devs and community!",True
"I'm not going to count for the launch day/week problems since this game blew up, and i imagine that the servers did too.

This game is an insanely fun, wacky take on battle royale gameplay, with the gamemodes and maps feeling just like something from takeshi's castle or wipeout.

The game is very quick and easy to lose, but also very easy to hop back in for another round without feeling like you've wasted a bunch of time, with the added bonus of gaining a bunch of in game rewards by just playing the game.

Even if you do suck at the game, you'll almost never get mad when you lose because the game hasn't sucked out 20 or 30 minutes of your time like other battle royales in the genre.

Overall, this game is one of the most fun, most enjoyable games of the year and I cant wait to see what comes next in terms of updates.",True

they're lots of good experience that you could think of

- not many maps at the moment
- 70% of the time you'll have to play the same map
- team game is very 50/50 (personally i don't really like it)
- Server issues 
- grabbing tail is the most annoying one

"Received this game as a gift. a couple bugs with connection, hopeful for more mini games to be added, since the games get a little repetitive after a couple games, and there to be 3 victors perhaps instead of one.

"This game is absolutely incredible. I've been looking for a great party game to play to relax to after a long day of work, and I've never been able to stick with one as they've gotten insanely boring after the first 2 hours of playing, however Fall Guys is immensely different. This game feels like a new run during every show & I'm excited to see what the future holds for the games in terms of new games to play, new cosmetics, so on so forth. This game is a slew of fun & I'm very happy with my purchase.",True
"A super fun, whimsical experience all around! It's a bit rough around the edges with a few bugs here and there, but there's ways those can be avoided or ignored. Played through the beta and then some more as it came out (before the servers borked) and it was as fun as I remember. Just as long as you're not the middle team in the team where you gotta get the ball to the end.

I'll be happy to see the bugs removed and the game being polished and embellished. I'm here for it!

Definitely recommend!",True

"Truly exceptional experience, Game was solid during beta, and definitely quite addicting!  Thought I wouldn't be into it because its quite cutesy but its a blast! In-game currency fairly priced for cosmetics! The launch has not been smooth due to capacity issues but what game has ? 

Their social pages have been extremely attentive keeping us updated on server progress and with the servers now stabilising the game is ability to break free and be productive IRL is waning. 

The games excellent, get it downloaded!",True
This is definitely a game worth playing. I’ve never laughed so hard. I can tell there are going to countless hours to be had here. Day 1 server issues are no reason to provide a negative review. It just shows that this game is in demand and good enough.,True
I've been playing since the first beta test and It's a cute game and so much fun to play with friends! Server issues are totally understandable especially when a game first launches! The devs are pretty wonderful and I know they have been working hard on this. I can't wait to see what gets added over time :) Will be sure to update this review later on.,True
Literally MXC: The Game,True
"Really fun and addictive, no matter how much you've played. There's like this thing where it gets a little tiring after getting the same maps but it's still very fun for the price of the game.

Perhaps it was a rough start as the game overflooded with players, patience is obviously important. 

Cute little gnomes with cute cosmetics where you want to see what more skins there will be.
In the future it would be really awesome to like decide more specifically which types of modes you want to play, if it's mixed, team games or single games.",True

Aside from that, the game is a 10/10 action packed bonanza. Better with friend, but great alone. With all this comes character customisation which leads to a high scale of diversity and creativity in the community. If you're complaining about the game's servers being glitchy, I would LOVE to see you try to handle 200K+ players at once on an indie game.",True

"I really don't see it going anywhere to me it gets boring after a few games not much to it. If they add new maps every week or some kind of tournament once a week with a different prize each time to change it up to constantly keep the game changing i believe it wouldn't get as boring and you wouldn't have to buy the battle pass or spend more money on skins in the store. Over all very colorful and the music bops but the music ticks me off on how up beat it, if i kept losing.
I did get a full refund on this game as of now i wouldn't recommend it but if i see it in the future with a lot more to it i might buy it again.",False
DONT GRAB MEEEEEEEE,True

IT IS UNPLAYABLE AND A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!! I want my money back because this game is ruined, you can not win in the later rounds. The cheaters fly above the map wasting the servers time until overtime happens so much the game ends and they get all of the EXP or  either win the later rounds. 
Mediatonic I want my money back or either put a system for us to report and or use our actual steam names so we can report people... This is not acceptable, maybe if it was free....",False
"Only played a few hours so far but its safe to say that its definitely worth a buy! Especially considering the price isn't bad compared to what some new games release at. I'd say it definitely needs some more maps soon which hopefully the developers are working on them and some new game mode. It does have a few things which would make the game a lot better such as when you don't qualify but your friend thats in the party with you does..it would be great if spectator mode immediately went to your friend rather than having to go through 30ish players trying to find them. There's a few other changes which would make it a lot better but as this game is new hopefully they can come in the future. A workshop mode would be cool aswell so people can make maps.

Anyway enough about what could be fixed..let's get into the good points. Its a super chill game that is super fun playing alone and with friends. It's also super funny and just a more happy/relaxing game compared to other battleroyal games. This one isn't as stressful so its a nice change. Some of the maps do have some challenging obstacles which is good as these things really keep the game engaging and makes you want to keep playing yo learn how to do these challenges. The game is also veryyy colourful so its pleasing on the eyes and aesthetic. Tbh I haven't come across any real game breaking bugs so the game is well made and very well polished. Some of the maps can get repetitive after awhile but due to how silly and fun this game is it is quite easy to look past that.
It also has great character customisation, they seem to have a bunch of different skins and colours/patterns to change your character too. 
So overall, this game is great. Definitely worth the price. It's fun, enjoyable, relaxing, funny and much more.",True
"This game is goated. Shame to see the reviews get bombed just because of the playercount wildly exceeding expectations and the servers struggling on launch day. It's literally a testament to how good the game is and how excited everyone was to play. GG devs, much luv yo",True

Skins are amazing too, you can spend for in game currency that you get by playing and getting gold/plats. It has also seasonal system where you get free skins and other cool stuffs for playing.

let's go play seesaw",True
"I have not seen a single cheater since the mid-season update, and that's great! Unfortunately, we've traded one problem for another: massive de-sync. All the tail-based games were bad enough before, now it's impossible to know when someone who appears to be 10 feet away from you is going to grab your tail, making it impossible to maneuver strategically. Also, tail games are more common than ever, including late-show games of tail tag with 10-12 people. Enjoy running around that giant map that was designed for groups of 30-40 trying to find anyone with a tail.

The massive de-sync also leads to you being jostled around uncontrollably anytime you are standing in a group of 4 or more players. This can shoot you into obstacles or off ledges entirely at random. All this, along with the new game selection algorithms and the random elements than can spawn on nearly every course, lead to the game being less skill-based than ever. You can be playing the best game of your life and suddenly get pushed into a pit by de-sync shenanigans, or be eliminated in a tail tag semi-final that shouldn't even be a thing.

The game had the right amount of random chance before, now it feels like I might as well be flipping a coin trying to get heads five times in a row just to get to a final round. (I'll delete or reverse this review when they delete all tail-based games from existence.)",False

"Alright, I bought this game during the early hype, and believe me it's good for what it strives to do- being to revitalize the Battle Royale genre in a way that somehow wasn't done before- but it still has A LOT of problems that its devs need to fix and hopefully will fix. Keep in mind most of these points are personal preferences, but who knows, maybe you'll relate.

- Number of different minigames to play. At first my friends told me that Fall Guys only had 25 different minigames to play, but to me at the time that seemed like a pretty hefty amount. Now though, the repetitiveness is beginning to set in.
   >> Solution: Hoping the devs continue to expand on Fall Guys with not just new skins and season passes, but also new maps/games. If not, then unfortunately I don't see this game having much traction after the initial hype for it dies down. (I mean come on, there was a whole bunch of stuff you don't see ingame from the PS4 trailer!)

- No crossplay. Bit of an annoyance how they signed that contract with Sony that only allows the game to be on PC or PS, but thankfully they said they were planning on expanding it to other platforms once it expires... hopefully.

- Team games. To me, adding team games to a Battle Royale is directly like taking a shit in someone's cereal. It clearly doesn't belong, and it makes you upset, appalled, or even enraged for reasons that are out of your control. Getting eliminated in a team game never feels like your fault, but rather the teammates the game randomly decided to pick for you.
   >> Solution: Either remove team games entirely or make them their own category.

- Tail games. My god, I hate these. Not only for how boring and irritating they are to even see in the game rotation, but also to merely play. As everyone knows the latency is awful, allowing opponents to grab your tail from several yards away while even if you're right against someone, your attempted grab will either fail or for whatever reason grab your target but not detach their tail.
   >> Solution: Either remove tail games entirely or fix the latency issue. Personally I would prefer to see them gone, but to each their own.

- Fall Ball and Perfect Match. These two minigames I despise in particular.
   - Fall Ball is always extremely irritating to see show up as it wholly relies on what teammates the game gives you. I would, however, say it IS a skill based game... if the ball physics in Fall Guys weren't so wonky and bipolar. Win or lose, I either feel bad for the enemy team or just want to move onto the next game. Not only that, but Fall Ball is a game that appears near the end of the Episode. If we have 8 people remaining, I don't want to be playing 4v4 Fall Ball!
  - Perfect Match on the other hand is a game I see people complain about being too slow, and I agree. Most players don't even bother trying to memorize the fruits on the tiles and instead just prefer to follow the herds of players that actually do like sheep. This does unlock the potential for trolls to ""punish"" players who didn't pay attention, but I'd say it still needs reworking... somehow.
   >> Solution: Either remove Fall Ball entirely or at least fix the ball physics. Absolute pain to play. Not much to say on Perfect Match, I just hope they tweak it a bit so it's more enjoyable and not as slow as it is now.

- Final games. You've got Fall Mountain, Hex-a-Gone, Jump Showdown, and Royal Fumble. I'll give my input on each.
   - Fall Mountain: Bad. While people may like Fall Mountain or defend it and say ""lol RNG is all a part of Fall Guys just get lucky lmao"" ...that would just be bad game design. One shouldn't have to trek through all those previous minigames only to be met with Fall Mountain as the final game and have all their progress wiped not by their own slip up, but a ball hurtling at their face they couldn't see or a swinging hammer they touched at juuuuust the wrong angle or speed. The crown floating up and down is also cheap, meaning even if you get to the front, the crown could be floating upwards and you'd have to wait, allowing either the player behind you or on the other side to simply grab it. I know it's the first map the devs made, but come on. One last thing, I've seen some players suggest swapping Fall Mountain with Slime Climb... but I'm not exactly sure how that would work.
   - Hex-a-Gone: Great, actually! This is a very simple game that can be mastered in numerous different ways. Cutting off a player and jumping across very wide gaps one by one to make it to a larger chunk of platform always feels amazing. Do you either decide to book it and destroy tiles as fast as possible to prevent opponents from having more space, or do you slow down and hop from tile to tile individually to conserve the space you have? The devs basically imported TNT Run into their game, and it works spectacularly.
   - Jump Showdown: Also good! Though not as exhilarating as Hex-a-Gone, Jump Showdown comes pretty close. The simple spin on Jump Club of adding an extra bar while making the minimum and maximum speed of each farther apart- along with the occasionally falling platforms- makes this an intense delight to play.
   - Royal Fumble: Bad. It's a tail game but as a final. It suffers the same problems as Fall Mountain, just feeling cheap to be thrown into what is essentially a roulette for a final game.
   >> Solution(s): Either remove Fall Mountain or swap it with Slime Climb (another more intense version of Slime Climb would be thrilling to see as a final, at least to me) and just remove Royal Fumble. There doesn't need to be a tail game as a FINAL.

- Infallible achievement. Why does this exist. WHO DECIDED TO PUT THIS IN?! Because of this achievement's existence, being eliminated in the game feels SOUL CRUSHING rather than just a minor inconvenience for any completionists out there. Getting 5 wins in a row requires an obscene amount of skill and luck... but unfortunately the way Fall Guys is as of now... mostly luck.

Despite all of those nitpicks, the game is still fairly fun. I might recommend buying it once it goes on sale, however.",True
Add voice chat so we can all scream at each other,True
"This game is seemingly great on the surface, fun to play with your friends, etc. However, it is so overwhelmingly filled with bugs and high latency, that it is impossible to recommend this game. They need to spend their money, not on adding randomization to each map (which day one caused literal shaking on some maps) or a trillion new costumes, but on fixing these issues. They have the income to do it now, just do it.Can you imagine spending all your time on just costumes and buggy randomization on each map (making Season 1 last the length of time between actual game sequels) instead fixing real problems? They can, but they just want to milk you for all your delicious creamy clams,",False

"What looks like a fun party game full of easygoing laughs is actually just a parade of intentionally bad controls, toxic people not actually playing the game, and about eight mini-games repeated ad nauseum. Three of those mini-games are just plain bad and everyone knows it, too, so realistically more like five mini-games and three teeth-grinding hexes cast by an old fortune teller.

There will be games you're good at, and games you're not good at. When you get a game you're good at, you will never lose. When you get a game you're not good at, you will never win. Because of the utter chaos of the game, there's no real way to improve, learn courses, or practice without some random physics curio throwing you around and ending your run. Thus the entire game is basically a series of coinflips, if the coin occasionally janked off the floor like a Skyrim prop.

Doing a silly obstacle course with 59 other people with slightly janky, limited controls? Kinda fun, once, maybe twice, maybe five times. It's certainly worth a laugh if you're a YouTuber, playing with friends, or otherwise in good company enjoying the game for the spectacle more than actually playing it. But if you're buying it for yourself, just trying to have a good time, it's more infuriating than fun.

It gets much less fun the eighteenth time your jump doesn't work or you bump into someone and jank off the platform, or when you lightly bump a motionless obstacle and your jellybean topples over like a geriatric drunk. Or, excitingly, when some uniformed member of the fun police just stands on a thin or small platform, blocking anyone from passing him for no reason except to obstruct everyone behind him.

Basically: Don't play Fall Guys. The game is barely fun at its core, it gets old fast, and the community are like every competitive game community - a negative-fun aspect to a game clearly meant to be played lightheartedly. For $30, I honestly feel like I wasted my money.",False
"This game had potential. It's just too repetitive, it's becoming toxic and it's just dying fast. It needs new stuff to work with and new minigames, adding a local or split screen will surely be a good thing. Lastly adding a ""Create your own minigame"" will maybe change the game's current state. These our just my suggestions and I hope this game will not fall... Get it cause fall guys? Anyways the point is it's dying fast and we need new stuff",False

"One of the most enjoyable games i have ever played. It perfectly shows that a game don't really need to be 100GB+ or ultra realistic graphics to entertain the player. You don't feel like you lost the match, even if you got eliminated, because you had fun during it.",True
"I would prefer to give a neutral rating but that isn't possible. Let me be clear, I'm not complaining because I think the game is unfair or not fun. I've won 20 crowns at the time of writing and believe this game can be a great deal of fun. However, for a game that is only multiplayer the desync is some of the worst i've seen. Ragdolling and player collision are some of the most frustrating experiences and require serious attention. The ability to grab other players is a fun gameplay mechanic but is wildly overpowered. There needs to be a risk to do it so that the one grabbing will have to think before acting. I can't count how many times I've lost the final round due to someone else grabbing me with no consequence of that action. If I could I would recommend whoever is grabbed to be able to move the grabber with their own momentum at around half the walking speed instead of being stuck like a statue.",False

Fun game 1000/10,True
"We played approximately 1 hour of matches and got the same 3 maps, over and over. Not sure if this is just unlucky matchmaking but this isn't enjoyable when you're expecting many different maps (which is what is advertised in the Steam screenshots). More game modes should be supported. This game has a lot of potential right now- the available maps look fun and colourful and the game seems enjoyable at a glance, too bad I never got to experience more than 3 maps.

As for my complaints with the current game, its multiplayer is not developed enough. When queuing up in a party there was a pretty high chance to get kicked, or disconnected, or even have one person load into a game and the other person not. You also cannot leave as a spectator while the screen is loading for the other players, so the remaining party members just have to wait on the title screen.

The 60-person FFA being the only mode takes away from how good the game could be. They should think of incorporating a ""loser's round"" for those who are eliminated, or even a ""ghost mode"" for players to try the later maps / practice parkour maps while not being alive. Larger parties should be supported, and able to play their own games without others.

As it is right now, this game is not even remotely worth the price. It feels like it should be free + with cosmetics that you have to pay for, like Fortnite, or even $5 with cosmetics. I cannot understand its current pricing when there are so many flaws. Hopefully this game improves in the future, since I have promptly refunded it for now.",False

Unfortunately the game felt really rough to begin with (connection issues and poor randomization of mini games) and now seems to be broken on Linux all together with the added anticheat. Obviously there is some risk buying a Windows game on Linux, but breaking something that was previously working seems like bad practice.

For team games consider making it so the possession based games are based on time the tail is held rather than just holding a tail when the timer runs out. There's literally no incentive to play them for 80% of the game and then just grabbing a tail at the end and winning.

"[h1] I've Fallen- I'm choosing not to get up [/h1]

I honestly wish I could do this review without bias. I truly, truly do. But I've never really found fun in Battle Royales- They just seem boring when they're familiar, and get annoying when they're unique. It's with no surprise that Fall Guys falls into the latter.

The issue was, I'm not sure where to put this in terms of ranking. Fall Guys is not a bad game- You might disagree, but I truly believe that Fall Guys is a well crafted game, with dodgy physics that feel unfair and sometimes unbearable, but with a wonderful cheery tune to it that honestly Team 17 forgets they can do extremely well. But for all it's upsides, Fall Guys does one thing wrong that, for me, drags it down into the cesspool.

A game is not fun when you are FORCED to work with others.

Human intelligence is fickle. It can range from strangely smart to pants-on-heads stupid in a matter of six people. If you have a friend group you can play with (Of which you can only take the standard 4), you'll be wrestling for control a lot more than you would otherwise. Fall Guys tries too hard to do something that doesn't fit its tone- it makes it so there can only be one winner, whether you're in a team or not, so players will feel more than willing to sabotage and sacrifice to get what they want.

When you're in a friend group, that might not seem too bad. After all, you can tell them where something is, or what's happening, or if they have a chance.

When the other 59 players are random, however, you're truly reminded how quickly someone shuts off their brain when they have no command. This isn't about the players who troll or grab, those people are malicious and have their own agenda that I will never argue with, save getting mad; I'm talking about those who, despite the fact nobody has qualified, believes that THEY MUST GO. The ones who want nothing more than to say 'FIRST' and run their entire team into the ground just to allow them to say they did the most work.

And the cheaters are rampant. There's no other way to put it- Cheaters plague this game like cockroaches, and you'll find that obvious just from running the gauntlet against them. After eight straight games of cheaters, I lost all fun in the game, just wanting nothing more than to report them and move on, but surprisingly enough there's not a report button; plus the permanent Streamer Mode that every person has means you can't even see who is doing it.

And just like that, Fall Guys gets the same treatment as every other Battle Royale- a place where people would rather be an invincible winner than a worthwhile loser, made worse by the fact that the 'work together' aspect doesn't even come into play because there can only be one winner. I'm sure that this review might be made redundant in the future; hell, I expect Fall Guys to win an award eventually, just like every big-name battle royale before it.

Now that I've gotten you down here, I would like to spin a theory by you. 

There's a reason Fortnite has lasted so long. By holding a stranglehold over the Battle Royale genre, Fortnite has convinced everyone to try and make a game that's better than theirs, which will crank out a steady stream of familiar games that can counter them. Apex Legends, Call of Duty Warzone, Fall Guys, to name a few. However, now that the games are out, they realised that there will always be the uphill climb of KEEPING a game good, which is where other battle royale games falter, their unique ideas falling away and letting Fortnite pick up the scraps. Fortnite is NOT a good game, and I will argue that point to the day I die.

But it is the BEST Battle Royale game, because it took everything that other Battle Royales put in first. The Respawn Van from Apex, the Vehicles from Warzone (Originally from PUBG, but PUBG is killing itself slowly anyway). And they feed on these ideas, make them more refined and tuned, until 'they came up with it first'. People won't even try and research into it. It's gotten to the point where Marvel have just partnered with Fortnite, which essentially canonises the game which I DESPISE.

Fall Guys is just another egg laid by the Fortnite Goose. And it will die, and Fortnite will absorb it back into the hivemind.

... Or not. To be honest, I kinda forgot I was suppose to be writing a review for a second there...

Overall, Fall Guys is not a bad game. It is bad in many things, but it is not a bad game. Unique, promising and unbalanced are the three words I'd used to describe it.

And every other battle royale game that came before it, too.

TOP 3 FUN THINGS TO DO:
⭐️Hugging fellow Fall Guys.
⭐️Celebrating at the finish line.
⭐️FINALLY winning a crown.

THE UNIQUES:
💎Total wipe out.

PLAYER GAMING REQUIREMENTS:
💼Multiplayer.
💼Battle Royale.

VERDICT:
This game has a lot of potential, if they can keep up with the fans demands by making more mini-games and improving the overall game then this will be played for many years. I was hooked from the get go but it doesn't go without it's falls, the biggest issue I see is the amount of hackers getting through and not being able to report them is a huge downfall. 

If hackers continue, the game will fall into a pit and potentially ruin the game for what it is. Everything else looks great and tons of fun can be had playing with friends/randomers. The game has a total wipe out theme which was a TV show I used to watch when I was younger, maybe that's where they got some inspiration?
Total Score = 85/100.

SIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:
Pummel Party, The Jackbox Party Pack.

GAMEPLAY:
Up to 60 players compete in matches with battle royale-style gameplay. Players, represented as jellybean-like figures, move around a three-dimensional playing field, with additional moves such as jumping, grabbing, or diving to assist gameplay. The aim is to qualify for subsequent rounds by successfully completing each of the randomly selected mini-games. Certain mini-games involve running towards a finish line at the end of the map, while others add elements of teamwork.

Players who are too slow or who fail certain requirements for a mini-game are eliminated. On the final round, the remaining few players compete in a final match with a randomised mini-game designed for a smaller player size. The winner of the match is the last player standing.

"Fall Guys is definitely a great and fun game to play either alone or with friends
My opinion and some suggestions:
- Improvements since the controller/keyboard stops working after a show and u are forced to restart the game
- Could be added a section called Profile in the Main Menu where it shows stuff like (Shows played, Wins, Ended in 1st Place during a show phase, etc)
- In the minigame Team Tail Tag why are we able to steal the tail of our own team mates? I believe it should be disabled since its a team game
- Increase the max number of participants in a lobby (4 is too low for a game who takes 60 players for a single show)
- Workshop for more creative maps and mini games
- Custom Mode to play with friends only
- Gets repetitive in long run
- Cheaters ruin the fun which is the main purpose of the game by making it completely unfair and theres not even a way to report them
- Shop items could reset automatically if u purchase them instead of having to wait for the whole shop reset

Jokes aside, the game itself has an unique features from its same genre of other games. The only thing I've hated so far is that my charachter being totally disabled and has to wait like 10 seconds to gets back on its feet. Other than that, it's much more enjoyable with friends.

",True
this game is extremely agitating. do not purchase unless you are ok with breaking everything you own. worth all the pain and suffering once you get that first win though.,True
"Fun in short bursts, tedious in long stretches (at the moment).

75% of all the minigames need some sort of rework.

Early game race maps need random factors to make replays feel varied and unpredictable while not being too punishing since they are the first levels.

Survival games like Roll Out, Block Party, or Perfect Match need to always end based on eliminations, and they need to be faster and harder as right now they are so easy they are a chore.

Team games are basically a random chance that takes 3 minutes to determine whether you won or not because your team's performance is irrelevant to your own individual one. Teams can also be uneven, making your random chance even lower. Fall Ball is also incredibly common because of it's flexible player count requirement, and I'm absolutely sick of this minigame. These are the worst and need to be their own game mode separate from the other game modes.

Right now there are only 3 final levels, Fall Mountain is a race where more often than not the person in the lead stays in the lead because there aren't enough factors to mix up player positions. Royal Fumble is basically luck based depending on whoever in the cluster**** manages to grab the tail within the last 5 seconds. Hex-A-Gone is actually really good. Make these better by transferring survival games here and making them progressively faster until only one person is left standing.

All these minigame problems could be alleviated by just having more games though. If you lose on a random chance you could at least look forward to what new games you'd play next round, but since things are repeated so often many of the maps feel like a chore. The number of levels increasing is likely to become the case as time goes on, but at the moment it Fall Guys biggest problem.

Some kind of visual variety in the maps would be appreciated too. After 10+ hours of play the bright colors are all tiring and none of the levels stand out as very unique or creative.

The game also has microtransactions which kinda inherently sucks, and there isn't enough of variety or customization options for costumes to really make you unique and stand out. Every Gordon Freeman costume wearer looks the same, excluding the face color, regardless of your pattern or color. Again, this will hopefully be fixed as more content is added over time.

Most of this review sounds negative, but because of how much fun I had playing it and how much potential it has for the future I think this would be a good game to support and maybe play in moderation right now. If you think the repetitiveness of the maps will be too much for you then hold off for now. The goal is to have this review become outdated simply by adding a substantial amount of new minigames. If this goal is achieved I genuinely think this game might become one of my favorites.

"Perspective: ~43 hours in Season 1. 14 wins. (Eight at Fall Mountain, four at Hex-a-Gone, two at Jump Showdown, zero at Royal Fumble). Took me until level 28 on the Season Pass to get my first win.

This game requires a baseline acceptance that weird and silly things will happen, but within your minimal movement abilities - running, jumping, diving, and grabbing - you'll find there is room for skill, positioning, and patience to give you more consistent results.

Grab-based games are the overall low point, due to the disparity in your opponents' position versus your own, making it seem like their grab range is much longer while yours is a lot shorter.

Cheaters that float and fly can be a bit of a problem, but team-based minigames have helped keep them in check (as more often than not, their teammates will throw the game to eliminate them).

I'm not a hundred percent certain the game will have legs in the long haul, but it is a lot of fun right now. $20 is a bit of a steep entry fee, but you can safely ignore the microtransactions (which just give you piles of currency you get by playing the game anyway) and know that no outfits affect the gameplay experience in any way whatsoever.

"As someone who usually isn't a fan of Battle Royales, this game had me hooked from the get-go.

Fall Guys has simplistic gameplay and a delightful color pallet. The obstacles aren't impossible, with only a select few being REALLY challenging. Each round tends to balance skill and luck pretty well (This keeps the game engaging). Although a majority of the teamwork rounds can be really annoying.

The pricing for the game at $20 is fair because of how popular the game is, how polished it is, how generous the in-game store prices are, how desirable almost ALL the skins, colors and animations are, etc...

Overall this game is highly enjoyable and quite addictive! Often the competitive nature of the game would leave me frustrated only to find that frustration gone a few moments later when I realize the absurdity of the game I'm playing. I'm looking forward to new seasons and hopefully new maps/courses as the only con is that I can see this game ending up a bit repetitive after a while.

"Fall guys is very fun, surprisingly intense and also a little rage inducing, but overall very entertaining. it is very simplistic, both the controls and the gameplay, meaning that anybody could play it and enjoy it. It is frustrating when you lose because someone grabbed you which made you fall, or if you get put in a team game mode with bad team mates, but it is very satisfying when you win a game.

The customisation is also a good part of the game, as you can win cosmetic items such as patterns, colours, headgear etc. from the season pass (which is free with the game), or you can buy items from the store with the in-game currencies. There are coins called Kudos, which you get from levelling the season pass or by participating in shows, and there are Crowns, which again can be earned from the season pass or by winning shows. kudos can be bought, but i don't feel pressured into buying them, or like im missing out if i don't purchase them, considering that kudos can be earned very easily just by playing, so all the items can earned by playing with an exception of 2 cosmetic skin packs which will give your a couple cosmetic items if you want them (at least as of the time of this review).

Unfortunately there are many hackers in this game who spoil the fun, so if you see someone go running faster than everyone else, jumping higher or diving farther than you, you'd be better off just getting yourself eliminated from the game. Oh, and of course if they're flying around too, they're obviously hackers.

(i got it wrong at the time i made this review, i said there were no micro-transaction currencies, when in-fact, you can buy kudos with real money, so i have updated the review)",True

- Cute character cosmetics and skins

CON'S:
- There is no way to report cheaters. There's been a lot of games with other people just flying out the map while others are working hard to win. I have screenshots and videos from my stream *coughs* twitch.tv/miipai *coughs* of these happenings. 

OVERALL:

I was attracted to the game because of funny clips I saw on Twitter and Facebook and immediately got my significant other a copy of the game (big mistake beccause he keeps pushing me off) but it was fun to play I love the little minigame and the thirst and hunger for the crown but please find a way to report cheaters because it's getting annoying being rob a possible win by people flyingn out the map.",True

However, this game is not worth $20, sure there are lots of things to do but in my opinion, $20 is not worth it. My opinion could change later but right now I just don't think It's quite worth it. Don't let me stop you from getting it if you're willing to spend the money, but anyone who is eyeing this game with not too much money, I would save it for a game with a little more content.",False

"I played Fall Guys for plus 25 hours, completed +120 episodes, got + 10 wins, and laughed as I never did.  

Gameplay Overview
Compete with 60 other players in 3 to 5 random mini-game rounds. At every round, players are eliminated and ONLY THE LAST ONE STANDING wins the crown.

There are 25 different kinds of rounds, most of them you will compete against all players and some are team-based. With 3 buttons (jump, dive, and grab) you will race, dodge, chase, use logic, push and grab to qualify for the next round.

RNG plays a huge role in the game and TO HAVE FUN WHILE PLAYING FALL GUYS be open to laughing about everything, even when you are the loser.

Here are the review toplines:
1.	Fall Guys is a silly game, really simple to play. 3 buttons and 2 sticks. 
2.	You play against 60 other players and the one that survives all rounds wins the crown.
3.	For most players, the controller will be more suitable than a mouse and keyboard.	
4.	Winning is great, but if you want to really enjoy Fall Guys, don’t focus on the win. 
5.	This game could be more expensive based on the gameplay experience it offers.

"This game looked cute. My wife had gotten it, and she was liking it, at first. Thought I'd give it a try, especially for just $20 USD.

The cheating is all over the place. They keep saying ""they'll trigger our anti-cheat and be gone by their next game.""  And yet, it keeps happening.

The griefing is absolutely rampant. There are people at the finish line trying to stop you from crossing. Every. Single. Game. They're not even trying to win, I've spectated them.  The grab ability needs to be turned off on any level where the gameplay mechanics don't require it. Period. My wife just about beat Slime Climb for the first time the other day, except that there were a whole row of people waiting at the finish line when she got there, and one pushed her back into a swinging ball, which knocked her off to her death. She logged out, left a negative review, and has hardly touched the game since.

Some of the level design is just horrible. There is little skill involved in many of them.....just the RNG of whether you start at the front of the pack or the back. Or blind luck running through the level (looking at you, Door Dash.)

The team games.....well, plenty has been said about the team games before. And if you get stuck on the yellow team most of the time, like I do, then you're doubly screwed there.

This game isn't worth $20. I've requested a refund, but over the played time limit, and right at the purchase time limit, so I probably won't get it. It wouldn't be the first time I've wasted money on a game, and it probably won't be the last. It is the first time I've actually bothered leaving a negative review, however.",False

"Hello my dear friends,

are you thinking about buying this game? You're gonna have to be aware of a couple of things beforehand.
Playing this game makes you feel like your brain is slightly damaged. While it might seem funny at first, after your first hour of playing this game your brain will most likely go back to the state of a 10-year old (if it ever developed in the first place).

You might think that it's an easy game since it's made for children, but I can assure you it's really not. Way too many adults without a life tryhard on it and grab your character in order to push you off the edge. If you're a competitive person who gets triggered easily, I would seriously not recommend playing this game as it almost made me punch my monitor 5 times. 
Only fun when you win and I'm too bad to win. Kinda fun with friends tho.",True

NICE GAME,True
"Fall guys is a beautiful proof that even the most simple game can be enormously hilarious and so enjoyable. I'd say I have spent a good amount of time playing/researching about the game, so I think I'm eligible for writing a review.
                          
                                                                     [h1] What is this game about? [/h1]

Each round of Fall guys starts with 60 players racing through the field full of obstacles and traps. First 30 people or so will qualify for the next round and gets a chance compete in an another round. There are few types of minigames and in each round it will randomly choose one of these. First and the most common one is race as I mentioned players are trying to reach the finish line as quick as they can. Second one is Team minigame 2-4 teams will compete against eachother and only certain amount will make it out. Most likely 1-2. These team games are pretty diversive too. Either you can push the rock through some obstacles all the way to the end, or you gotta gather as much eggs as you can and deliver them to your team basket. 
Now, after my short summarisation of what is this game about, let's take a look on positive/negative things about this game. 
I'll start with positive ones.

[*] This game provides fair amount of funny and diverse games and It's only going to grow.

[*] It's definitely worth to mention the Community manager on social media. Hands down, the best I have ever seen. This ain't no large corporation which acts strictly within the profesional manners how almost every company does. No, he acts like a regular guy just like you. He's open to any kind of criticism/joke and anything. But one thing, that really makes me to support this game and its creators is the fact, that they have made a fundraising activity to support the UK charity called SpecialEffect that's levelling the playing field for gamers with physical disabilities around the world. They have challenged all brands around the world to donate any amount of cash, to get their skin into the game. The one with highest donation due to the next week will win. It's beautiful, this shows that games nowadays are not just about playing the certain game, but it can also help people in need and gather players all around the world to spend time together. 

[*] Another point that I wanted to highlight is the look adjustment. Skins are simply done and provides each player its characteristic look. You can mix anything you want. You can be either Hot dog with pigeon's legs or even Scout from TF2!

[*] I love the fact that this game has completely different perspective on battle royale genre and It's unique in its own way.

[*] Anticheat - Even though they will let hackers pass through, I can guarantee you they won't be flying all over your head for too long.

Now the negatives. [h1] MIGHT EDIT WHEN THINGS GET BETTER! THIS IS CURRENT STATUS OF THE GAME [h1]

[*] Server status after release. I get it, they haven't expected so many players to play this game at once and it exceeded their expectations, so It's understandable.

[*] The minigames might get repetetive after you'll spend hours of continuous gaming session. This is pretty subjective, and I'm really enjoying it but some of u guys might not, so this is neutral point.  Also.. There's pretty easy solution for this. They will simply add more minigames / maps. 


Fall Guys is adorable, silly game filled with a genuinely dramatic moments and heartbreaking loses. You might enjoy this game in small doses instead of undisturbed hours and hours long session.

[h1] I gives this game a solid 8/10 and might be even better/worse as time goes.",True
buy,True
pog champ,True
SECOND best game,True
"I'm having a blast playing Fall Guys right now. It's a lot of fun with friends. But the big question I want to answer, is the game worth $20 right now?

If you have a group of friends who you know will pick up this game, then it's worth it to play with them, because this game is incredibly fun in short and medium bursts. If you're a solo player, then I would not recommend it right now. The devs said they're adding content into the game, but right now there's not enough content that makes this worth $20. The mini-games can start to get repetitive and some of the team-based mini-games feel particularly unfair when you don't have anyone else to coordinate with. [strike] Also how are there so many people who don't understand how a See-Saw works?!!?!? [/strike]

This game will have more content than it does right now, in maybe 6 months to a year, and it'll probably go on sale a couple times as well. At that point I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone if they liked the trailer or concept (if the game didn't die by then). But right now.. I would still recommend the game, but only if you know that you'll have friends to play it with. I would not recommend it for anyone who's looking to play it solo, you'll start to get bored of the game after 4-5 hours.

3/5",True
"it's a fun game, but it slowly went down the spiral when there's a good chance there's a hacker in every game you join, and no one seems to be talking about it",False

"There's many things wrong with this game currently that make it very frustrating to play:

Game is insanely inconsistent - On one person's screen you can be way ahead of someone in a race, but on another person's screen you'll be way behind the same person. There's been multiple instances where I've clearly won a final on my end, but I was beat by someone who was behind me. This makes it so that there's no way to possibly know if you're actually in first place until the end when the game decides on who was ahead.

Games aren't fun - Some of the games are so poorly designed that it would literally be more fun to flip a coin to decide if you advance or not.

Hackers - I've run into multiple people hacking with no way of reporting them in game or finding out their names, which just promotes being able to hack without getting caught. Very frustrating to make it to a final and then lose to someone flying above the map.

All in all, the game is fun if you're just messing around with friends and are fine with being robbed of the occasional win.",False
The most competitive game I have ever played,True
"Kinda fun in the first week with few cheaters. Neglecting the cheaters, given u have a chance of winning, it's definitely addictive and fascinating for party games.

"Fall Guys is the perfect game for playing with your friends or solo when looking for a fun casual experience. Pushing other people off the map while trying not to get eliminated is the most unique experience in the battle royale genre yet. The character customization is very good and everything can be buyed with only in-game currency. Being so simple yet so fun, Fall guys is the best option when trying to game with a short amount of time, the game loads very quickly even on a hard drive and every match lasts between 2 to 7 minutes. When solo, this game might not be the best option for a long gaming session, but together with friends it's easy to spend a whole afternoon without even realising. A must buy!",True

"Fun game, but unfortunately is plagued by cheaters. The team-based maps which many people are negative on exist only to filter out cheaters, if they end up in the losing team. Some cheaters have the courtesy to reveal themselves in the very first round, so you can just leave the game and requeue. Other cheaters are sneaky and will only reveal their cheats at the final round, giving you false hope and making you waste time.

Regarding cheaters, the Fall Guys support page says, [i]""The likelihood is, if you saw a cheater, it was their first and probably their last time cheating - they tripped our anti cheating switch and the next game they have been detected.""[/i] This statement might have been accurate at some point in time, but there are now cheaters with legendary costumes, which means they have been around long enough to win 5-10 matches.

Another sore point are the server desyncs. This is emphasized in the tail grab maps, where you have to be in close proximity to another player to grab their tail, but they are able to grab yours from further away. While this is an annoying issue, it is something you can adapt to overtime unlike having cheaters in the game.

Stay away until Mediatonic comes up with a legitimate anti-cheat system. As it is, you can only report cheaters by submitting a ticket, but even this feels pointless as the 4 numbers that make up player names aren't unique.",False
"This game appears to be promising, but over, and over, it just falls flat and leaves you in a very irritated state, wanting more from it.


The worst part is this game has a lot of potential and does a lot of things right, the games physics feel great. How you jump for platforms feel great too, I like the overall game feel. A lot of the stages are fun and have a little chance without it being over baring with complete bullshit (some stages are however a little like this.) and I can't wait to see more new ideas even if they are mix matches of the current ones. However, what this game does lack is different game modes so that more team based stages are set to occur more often if you play with friends. This small thing sucks because most multi team stages can end you up with a bad team which ruins the game if you do really great, but your team just sucks.

Why did I write this review so early and give it such a negative response? Well, even though I never ran into any hackers playing, I experienced some issues playing. For one sometimes the game would load weird and intro animations wouldn't finish, don't know what that is all about but it wouldn't give me a full view of the level. Another thing was some intro animations for the stages were kinda... longer than expected. I'm sure both these problems could be fixed and they aren't really that bad, just worth mentioning. But what really peeved me was that when I was playing my last two games, I got dropped from them for internet connection issues. I don't have the best internet but I was not suffering from that issue at all. I'm the only one who uses the internet and for it to just drop me back to back really ruined the taste in my mouth.

Once again, the game is fun but all the little things adding up really can make the game frustrating. I really want to see the game improved, and I hope the devs do. But as of right now, this game could do a lot more, it feels almost unfinished, kinda like a beta back when betas were actually (nearly) finished games that needed testing and R&D. One recommendation I would suggest, add casual and competitive. Stages that can be a lot more chance or bull get shot into the casual while competitive is more for skill based stages.

Day 2: New round, new adventure. So far won 4 rounds no problem but then it was Hexagon Finale for the winner but I was already celebrating earlier and I thought I won so I just jumped and was like: BEHOLD YOUR WINNER!

"Based off of popular game shows like Wipeout and Takeshi's Castle, Fall Guys is a fun, multiplayer minigame battle royale. However the game has a few faults at the current time of this review which I will outline below.

The Bad:

- There will be points where your guy will randomly stagger which can cause losses. This can be reduced by diving but it seems inconsistent at times.

- Team games can be incredibly frustrating as well, as when you perform your best you could be dragged down by the rest of the team. Again this can be compensated by having a squad of friends with you as they will be on your team, which may be difficult for some.

- Lastly the pushers, there will be players that will actively try to throw you off games which can be very frustrating. This can also happen for player collisions as well, although this can be reduced by learning shortcuts and tricks to avoid being pushed.

The Good:

- Having said all that, the amount of variety in the game is good and there seems to be an interest in the developer to expand, improve and adjust games in the future.

- Although it may not interest everyone, the customisation options is also great, and has minimal micro-transactions, where you have to earn cosmetics with either Kudos (the normal currency that you earn) or crowns (acquired through winning the whole game).

- The music and visuals is great and sells the idea that the game is centred around a game show.

The Ugly:

- Currently there are a few hackers running around, where they may randomly speed through levels or fly in the air. Wall exploits have also existed and seem to be patched currently, but this could be an issue that could be reintroduced in the future.

- Some game modes as stated before can be very frustrating. To name a few: tip toe, hoarders and egg scramble adopt a play style where a scapegoat is needed to either win or improve your chances of victory. 

- Cosmetics costing crowns can also be very disheartening for players who are very casual, and will lock out these players for some of the cosmetics on offer. 

Conclusion:

Overall, fall guys is a very fun experience, and introduces a new battle royale genre. However if you hate platforming and team games, this may not be for you. Score: 6/10

"This game was not on my radar until one day prior to the release. I hesitated buying it for just over a week because the price seemed a bit high; however, I've played about 20 hours in the short time I've owned this and now feel the price is possibly a little low for the hours of fun I've already received from playing. If the price is the only thing stopping you, I honestly recommend taking the leap. This game is amazingly fun and strangely addictive!",True

Too many times have I been in a level and randomly die with no lag or anything.

"A chill out battle royale - that will definitely make you curse.

It needs some tweaking here and there but overall, a LOT of fun even when you are not winning.",True
"The game is actually pretty fun, but still gets a dislike for some game breaking reasons:

1. The game is supposed to be a fun/party game, sadly you HAVE to win to get crowns which you need for all the cool skins. Crossover skins for example cost 10 crowns to fully obtain. The problem with this is, that it turns the game into a strong competitive game where skill gives you no favor. The game is too random and bad plays get rewarded. (Example final maps)

2. The game is already full with cheaters who want to obtain crowns, so that they can buy cool skins (I can kind of understand them)... In 10 games you have at least 1 cheater... One reason more why the crown system is so bad...
Edit: 1 in 5 games now. Even 2 in the same round sometimes...

3. Game breaking bugs... The game has multiple bugs, which just destroy the fun and should've been at least patched with the first big patch... Here just a short list:
- Every refresh rate over 60 Hz makes your game blurry and laggy. (Also includes gameplay) Rip 144Hz..
- After your first game you will have tour mouse cursor floating around the screen... (Come on... really?)
- You will get stuck everywhere (Mostly why you will die) and then start to fly around the map...
- Grabbing doesn't work how it is supposed to be 70% of the time. (For example grabbing eggs and tails )
- People can grab your tail from 10m away. You touch tails and nothing happens.
- A friend can't play the maze game, because he turns into a ferrari whenever he steps on the plates and just gets shot forward.
- Weird disconnects which kick you out of the game right before your final...
- Really often you just fall out of nowhere without any collision.
- Disconnects in the final round.

4. Teamgames are just too random, because your skill doesn't matter if you have a team of dummies or are placed into the yellow team. You win 4 games in a row, and then just get slaughtered in a teamgame, because your own skill doesn't count anymore... thanks very much...
Also sometimes you have teams where one side has more players than the other...

5. Like I already stated, the crown system is just bad right now... you are forced to tryhard the crap out of a game which is totally random to even have a chance for some cool skins. There should be other ways to earn some crown. And I'm not talking about 3 crowns in 60 days from a battle pass. Then the game could be the funny party game it's supposed to be...

6. The skin system/shop system is basically trash because of the crown system, so this could actually be the same point. The really cool skins (like crossover skins) cost 10 crowns but switch after 3 days already for replacement items.... how are you supposed to get them? Why do legs even cost 5 crowns like the body part? With the current system it's just impossible.

Right now I can really not recommend this game to anybody. Yes it may be fun for the first 5h, but afterwards it is just a pain to play it.

It's good for short bursts and can be great fun with friends who get into the spirit of the game but can become tedious quickly when you're running the same map for the 5th time in a row.

"I have three hours on steam but 20+ on PS4

Quite frankly this game has potential: amazing potential in fact, if only it wasn't bogged down by simple errors. 
First, the game types. Most are pretty fun. Others, not so much. Pretty much any of the team based games, sure, one might say they are needed to preserve the random zany aspect of the game, but I would argue that it inhibits the game instead. The current game engine is unstable and is honestly sad to witness in it's current state. The main problem with this game is the inbalance between skill and RNG. For some people, this will be fine. But for the player who gets frustrated easily when you are beat down by nothing but the will of the system, it is almost impossible to enjoy. For game modes where skill is more needed such as Slime Climb, the problem here is the simple fact that other people exist. Depending on the position you start in, good luck getting past the half way mark, as not only are there the course objects you must avoid, but you must also watch out for your fellow players. Once again, depending on the type of content you enjoy, this zany and in my opinion frustrating gameplay would suit you just fine. For me, however, it's, little more than frustrating when you are beat down by not only your fellow players, which in a battle royale setting where disqualifying your fellow players isn't needed until the last or so round, but also the game mode itself decides to make you the bully target of the round. Call me insensitive, but I honestly feel this game is little more than glorified RNG and playerbase bullying.",False

"[h1]FALL GUYS[/h1]
This game gives you an opportunity to take part in Wipeout by yourself. Every dozen of bulb-like heroes will compete to reach the well deserved [b]crown[/b] after outrunning up to 59 other smiley faces in stages such as races, logic levels, team cooperations and even elimination. It's hard to win the game over all but if you start learning the basics, it becomes so much easier to manage to beat it and believe me, the feeling of power and superiority when you are the last one standing is amazing.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2197624060

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
It feels simple but if you really want to show your dominance, you need to master the basics such as walking, jumping, grabbing and ducking. To walk properly you need to avoid going sideways if the path is straight and it has no danger near you as you gain momentum while just going straight. Jumping is pretty easy in this game but you need to have a common sense of timing and also know how high you actually 'jump'. Grabbing is pretty simple, if you have to grab a tail just grab it when enemy is near. Ducking is pretty obvious in this game, you lose control over your bulb when doing it and it lasts for a short amount of time to get back on your feet. Remember to never duck when doing the final race for the crown as you can't grab when you are ducking.
The last mechanic is the elimination mechanic. After each stage actually a chunk of players (arround 20-30%) gets eliminated as they didn't meet the requirements such as claiming their slot until it runs out, got eliminated as they fall out in the elimination maps or got erased with the whole team that was last.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2197624327

[h1]Maps & Modes[/h1]
There are actually plenty of maps that can appear on each stage of the game and every single of them is unique. I have listed the modes before and since the game is really fresh they are getting added regularly.
Some of them challenge you to beat the obstacle course before remaining slots get claimed by other players, some want you to survive the course of obstacles running literally into your face. Team cooperation is the mode that requires several players on each team to work together to avoid getting eliminated as always the last team, the one that sucks enough gets their next stage tickets taken. Logic games ask you to remember the correct path or block and stay on it or other way you are getting punished by ending your journey.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2197624169

"I can not recommend the game in it's current state as there are simply too many cons.

 - The game is too expensive for what you get ($5 - $10 would be reasonable not $25-$30). There is not enough content in the game to justify the high price tag.

 - The team games are literal CANCER. You can be 2-3 games into a match, put on a bad team and lose which is totally out of your control. Some of the team games can be very hard to come back from as well. The egg game in particular is very difficult to come back from if you are losing badly as everyone tends to be trying to steal the eggs from the winning team which results in the eggs not being moved because of too many people around them. The team games should either be removed or should be the first and second game ONLY, not in late stages of the match. None of the team games are enjoyable, they are just frustrating and make you angry when you lose. Imagine playing PUBG, Warzone, Fornite etc and when you get to to the 3rd zone you have to flip a coin and if it's tails then you're out. This is what the team games feel like, it doesn't matter how much effort you put into the previous games, you can just get screwed by bad luck (which happens a lot).

 - Some of the games rely too much on randomness. The fake door and fake tile games are absolute garbage and are the worst offenders of this. Randomness has the same problem as the team games. You can be 3-4 games into a match and lose for reasons out of your control or just because of bad luck, rather than because of a lack of skill.

- Some of the games are too easy and short. Some of the maps are simply just too easy and there isn't any chance of catching up if you fall behind. For example, if you start at the back and are unable to get past the huge pile up that tends to happen at the start of the levels, then gg.

How to make the game better?
 - Remove team games or make then the first and second games ONLY in a match.
 - More skill based games and less luck/random based ones.
 - Some harder and longer games modes. Maybe more vertical levels where you can be pushed back down to the start.",False

"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a 2020 battle royale game. 

[b] Gameplay [/b]
Up to 60 players join a match in battle royale-style gameplay. Players move around a three-dimensional playing field, where the aim is to qualify for subsequent rounds by successfully completing each of the randomized pre-selected mini-games.

I have only played the game for around 12+ hours on and off. I find it fun in short bursts, tedious in long stretches. I hardly play it alone and it is 200% more fun when played with a group of friends. I personally hate playing the team-based games when I solo queue. You could be doing well by yourself and have an AFK player or an unfair start with the team you happen on is down a player. 

The only “real” issues I have with the game are minor. First off, the game is being overloaded with the sheer number of people trying to play. The servers have been struggling and the devs are working on a permanent solution. Occasionally, I encounter issues leaving the current match and going back to the lobby. I have to either force quit the application or wait until the current match is over. Accepting an invite from another friend solves this issue but not if you’re playing alone. This might be related to the ongoing server issues.

Another issue is the cheaters in the game. I’ve only played one game with a cheater and it wasn’t fun. I expect the devs to come out and make a “report player” option down the line. Although there is currently no way to report in-game cheating, Meditonic has advised its user to report them in their Discord channel or the Fall Guys subreddit. The developer has also assured the title contains anti-cheating tools, “but we’re still tuning them as we get more data from launch!”

I don’t mind that you can spend money to get outfits or celebrations, you can earn them as you play and it doesn’t affect the core gameplay.

"[h1] My Thoughts [/h1]

Let me start off with this is an amazing game for £15, it is exactly like Total Wipeout I used to watch on BBC One in 2008, Amazing servers [spoiler] (which loads of people complained about), [/spoiler] The PC game can run on a basic laptop and it doesn’t compromise on System Resources, I can’t stop playing this game it’s so addicting!

[h1] Pros [/h1]

[✔] Impressive Graphics!

[✔] Rounds are fast so it’s easy to get to another match if you fail to qualify!

[✔] More Fun with Friends/More Fun watching your friends win & fail! 😈

[✔] Great Items to buy with your Crowns [spoiler] (when you win the game!) [/spoiler] and Kudos!

[h1] Cons [/h1]

[❌] Does feel like déjà vu so sometimes you could last an hour by yourself!
[❌] Team Games seem a bit difficult but they seem alright for the most part!
[❌] No Private Games so you can practise with friends so you are forced to go straight in the public lobbies!

I can’t wait to see what new modes and costumes the game developers release, and I recommend this game to my friends and family!",True

"Great game for a great price! Even though the game had a rough start due to the servers not being able to handle the high volume, they have quickly fixed this issue and have been making sure to maintain them. I enjoy basically everything the game has to offer.

[b]TL:DR[/b]
-Minigames are fun (with the exception of most team games)
-Hefty amount of Fall Guy customization (also like that some items can only be obtained using a currency only obtainable by winning games)
-Battle pass system and Devs continuing to add new content to the game allows for this game to have longevity

[b]Longer Version[/b]
I think the minigames for the most part are fun, but I have issues with the team based games. In comparison to the other minigames, team based games feel slow and if you win or lose is usually just based upon what kind of people are on your team. There are good team games though with Rock 'N' Roll being a favorite of mine. Even though there are pretty lacking team minigames (with Fall Ball, Hoarders, and Egg Scramble being the biggest offenders), I think due to how much input the devs take from the community could hopefully lead to future team games being more entertaining.

I think the amount of customization is great. You can edit the color and pattern of the body, the face color, and what clothes (if any) you'd like to wear for the top and bottom half. The ability to mix in mach the top and bottom allows for a lot of variety (as well as a lot of clipping or sometimes just invisible/see through parts). I also like that some cosmetics are locked behinds a crowns currency which you can only obtain through winning games (as well as the battle pass, but there are only a couple in there). Only thing I could imagine them doing to allow for more customization would be things like allowing the player to change the color of the clothes to some presets, but I know there is already some reskins of costumes with the pigeon and dove being an example of this.

Finally I want to say that I love how much longevity this game has the ability to have due to the devs planning to add more content through seasons with new battle passes, stages, and costumes. I feel like one thing that could extend it even further would be if they were to make a workshop page where people could create stages and costumes which could then be downloaded and used for custom matches (which are currently not a thing but should be added), or even better, could be voted upon to see what should be added in the future almost like how TF2's workshop works. This could allow this community to go on for a long time if all the Devs need to do is add user made content.",True
"Lots of fun, especially with friends!
Plenty of games and every round is different so it doesn't feel repetitive.
I personally haven't noticed any issues with lag.

Only changes I'd really implement is more game modes for end game specifically and perhaps a private lobby option for parties etc.",True
Twice the pride double the fall!,True
你这个比 别拽我屁股啊啊啊啊 我要冲了！,True
"I hardly ever buy a game when it first comes out, purely because of the asking price that most developers ask for these days.

However for £15.99, the money-to-fun ratio exceeds far beyond my expectations!

I have only owned Fall Guys for 1 day now and I have been playing it non-stop. It is a great game with a friendly atmosphere that you can play mindlessly for hours on end.

Great levels. Great soundtracks. Great Fun.

Fall Guys is a bit of the tv show Wipeout, Takeshi's Castle, and Mario Party wrapped up into a colorful package.  You control a little dude who competes against 59 other contestants in various skill & luck based levels.  It definitely meets the multiplayer party game criteria.   Levels often go pretty quick, typically within 1-3 minutes.  Some might last a little bit longer, but I haven't really kept track of that.  There's a decent amount of variation with the levels.  It's very possible for you to love a level, and someone else to absolutely despise it.  

Most levels are about skill, making it from one part of the level to another while avoiding obstacles and other players.  Some levels are about teamwork, and each time one pops up in a round I can't wait for it to be over.  In a game that's mostly about you vs everyone else, it seems misplaced to have a team based level in the middle of your race to the top.  It doesn't help that the team based games aren't exactly the best.  Jump through rings, push a ball, push multiple balls, or collect eggs(the worst).  Maybe you get lucky and you have players that know the ins and outs of what needs to be done and you win.  Or maybe you've got a bunch of new players that aren't familiar with the best ways to win.  It often doesn't matter how well you do if your team isn't very good on average.  You're most likely going to watch that round end with a drastic message of ""Unqualified.""

Now aside from my displeasure with the team based levels, the rest are pretty fun.  You've got to make it across see-saws, through fake doors, over rising/falling doors, avoid falling fruit, make your way up while avoiding rising slime, and a handful of other levels.  They're difficult enough to keep a veteran player on their toes, and accessible enough for a player that's less experienced.  Here's hoping there are more levels like this throughout the game's life.

Each game nets you some kudos(cash), and some experience.  As you increase in level you unlock new rewards, which are cosmetics, crowns, or kudos.  Each day you have the option of buying new skins or costumes from the in-game store, and there have been many costumes thus far.  Kudos gain feels decent enough if you're doing well.  If you're rarely making it past the first round it may seem like you're never going to earn enough to buy anything.",True

-The team games are sh1t. Some people love to sabotage the team
-Cheaters. I've seen some speedhackers, hope they will add a report button soon",True
"Holy fucking shit. I want to bang the fall guys guy so goddamn bad. I can't stand it anymore. Every time I go to the Dizzying Heights I get a massive erection. I've seen literally every rule 34 post there is of them online. My dreams are nothing but constant fucking sex with the fall guys guy. I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers and knowing that those are nuts that should've been busted inside of the fall guys guy's tight fall guy pussy. I want her to have my mutant human/fall guy babies.

Fuck, my fucking mom caught me with the neighbors balloon. I'd dressed it in my sister's skirt and went to fucking town. She hasn't said a word to me in 10 hours and I'm worried she's gonna take away my PC. I might not ever get to see the fall guys guy again.",True

Edit:
Well, annoying players have started appearing. This is slowly turning into ""push people to get them eliminated,"" or ""be a complete butt to the other teams' eggs/balls,"" in order to win. Still recommended for short bursts of fun, but I think I'm already getting exhausted with it tbh.",True

Great game if you're looking to play something for 20 minutes. Could do with a few more maps or even have community servers like CSGO has for more different gamemodes and such. 9/10 would recommend to anyone.,True

The amount of changes and things they've rolled out in the last (almost) week to improve the Quality of the Life of the players and server stability is absolutely respectable in the time it's taken to do such changes.

Hats off to Mediatonic and Devolver Digital and the teams responsible. This is probably going to be something I'll play and recommend to people for a long time.",True

Great to play with friends
You can get cosmetics from just playing instead of buying
Its not a pay to win game

Cons:
Could do with some more mini games 
Maybe some other modes as well such as private games",True

A battle royale game where you don't hide for 20 minutes straight? It's a must buy!,True
"Extremely fun and addicting game. It's like Mario Party Battle Royale. It's cute as hell. My only wish is that someday they make custom lobbies so streamers can invite people to play with them en masse instead of just a 4-person party. Keep up the good work, devs!",True
"This game is fun in spirit, but there are major flaws within the game. The first major mistake is implementing team play in a game that has a singular winner. The team play is absolutely toxic because you cant rely on yourself to win, but you have to rely on randoms that may be garbage at the game. The singular games are great because the ball is in your hand whether you drop it or carry it. I suggest that the team game modes be set aside for team play ques. I believe alot of people may share the same thought process when it comes to pushing a ball and your teammates are jumping on your back instead of pushing. 

P.S I played more of the game and its trash overall, the game modes are pretty ass, and the final challenge barely rotates, the hexagon and tail challenge is so trash.",False
i fell,True
"The gameplay is fun and smooth, but overall, as a product, it does not feel the most polished in its current state. For the times I have been able to actually join a game and play, I've had a lot of fun and it is a very enjoyable game. I enjoy playing both alone and with friends, and I personally really enjoy all the race games a lot. The gameplay itself feels really polished, and the graphics are adorable and super satisfying to look at. I would definitely recommend this to friends if it wasn't so buggy in its current state, but as it stands, it's a bit of a roulette as to whether getting this game is a positive experience or not. 

When in an actual game, there generally aren't many issues and it feels good to play, but trying to actually connect to a game is troublesome and more often than not, impossible due to the connectivity issues. There are also small things like the flow of the home menu not being the most logical (you can't press escape to leave sub-menus like the customization page or settings, and you can't press escape on the home menu to exit the game) which are not necessarily deal-breakers, but should be more well thought out. Menu-wise, it feels like they just took the console version and copied and pasted it onto pc without thinking about how differently the two platforms act. Another bug that occurs rather often is the esc key bugging out, causing you to not be able to leave a game without having to close the entire game manually. 

I definitely see the potential this game has, but there's also a lot of room for improvement with regards to its current experience. 

tldr; 
It's a fun game, but is too buggy and unpolished in its current state for me to recommend it wholeheartedly. It feels more like a polished beta, than an actual released game. If they fix some of these basic issues (connectivity issues, being trapped in game because the esc menu bugged out), I would definitely recommend it to everyone, but until they do, I'm very on the fence as to whether or not it was worth the $20 to buy.",False

1- A game like this MUST have a local multiplayer, I hope they start working on this as soon as possible. 
2- The game could let the players create their own room (public or not), that way we wouln't be limited by the 4 person groups.
3 - I didn't play it a lot yet but I feel like it needs more levels or people will start to get bored/sick of the game fast.

This game is great fun, even more so with friends. No wonder it just exploded when it came out two weeks ago lol. 

It has SO MUCH potential to be a super fun game for ages with updates. I'd also like to point out  that not having a way to communicate in game is a good decision towards keeping the comunity toxic free haha. Also, follow their twitter so you can get a laught or two once in a while xD",True
This game is nothing but pure fun; even when you lose.  A lot.  I can't wait to see what else they add in the future.,True
My only dislike about this game is that is is addicting seriously its amazing would reccomend,True
"This game is exactly what you'd expect it to be. A casual, yet still a competitive game with very little commitment considering the short average length of each run. It's a game you'd quite easily fall into (no pun intended) as learning the basic controls as well as each minigame is a breeze. Fun with friends or without, for long periods as well as for just a quick game.

Con: Lack of minigames. This is slightly premature, considering the game just dropped. As of now the game could have passed as a phone game, but adding for example a workshop of sorts for players to get creative and make their own minigames could elevate it a tad.",True

"TL;DR needs new maps and a separation of the solo and team based maps and better monetisation methods.

I'm only not recommending due to some issues that need to be addressed. Overall the game is great but there are some shortcomings some people should be aware of. I still have fun with this game and planned on playing it in short bursts so I was happy to jump into it already knowing that it wouldn't be completely expansive gameplay wise. If I could I would just give a ""mixed"" rating instead of having to pick ""Yes"" or ""No"".

Right now, you jump into a 60 man lobby, complete an obstacle course to narrow down the numbers to 30-odd and then compete in either more races, a memory game with falling platforms or team based games. The racing/obstacle type courses are pretty fun and can easily turn into mayhem if too many people bunch up in a section. The fun stops on the see saw level where if you're not in the 1st or 2nd row you're pretty much screwed as the see saws will pivot way too far to 1 side and stop you from being able to progress. This goes for 1 of the finale races too. 1 of the only 3 finale levels features you trying to be the last man standing with each platform you touch disappearing. Think Fish Upon A Star from Mario Party 5.
The team based games definitely need to be changed. There's nothing more unappealing than watching others prevent you from progressing to a win. These should be relegated to their own dedicated playlist for team games and allow party sizes of up to 6 or 8 to encourage more of a party type feel that this game is going for.

As for extra maps it'd be great to see further expansion to the obstacle formula as those maps work the best. Introduce time trial type ones for lower numbers where everyone has their own separate course to run through and then it becomes a matter of individual skill, or introduce more platforming based arenas where jumping across platforms is more prominent. Something to change it up at least a little bit.

Now for another reason people might not wanna buy this game. The cosmetic store. I know that games like this can't be sustained forever without a revenue stream but it's a paid game with premium currency. Winning earns you crowns which is also a currency and cosmetic items can't even be purchased to your content. A small handful of items are available on rotation which just encourages FOMO (fear of missing out) and might heavily push some players into spending more money just for an item they like the look of. Maybe a battle pass you buy would have felt less egregious but time will tell how the devs handle monetisation.

Otherwise, as I mentioned there is some good fun in this game. The physics aren't completely goofy like Human Fall Flat so you don't have to worry about being thrown around too much and a whole 6 round run can be completed fairly quickly with relatively short matchmaking times as of writing.",False

"This game is so much fun. Even if you play it alone, I mean, you will fight your friends anyway at the end of the day. So, partying up is not necessary, it only adds more laugh.

Yes, team game is a bit BS. But you can still win in games like football even if your team outnumbered by the opposing. Sam with the finals, Fall Mountain, Hex-a-gone, and Royal Fumble. All fun, even a bit random. There's slight skill plays. I can get wins more often than my whole Discord server friends. So, not too random. You just need to know how to play the game.

At the end of the day. Don't take this game seriously. It's a battle royale, in a different way.",True

Physics are fucked aswell, you want to kick the ball? nope, you kick it backwards even though you hit it from behind.

The enemy can throw objects way further than you can and they can push you harder than you can.

People with lagg have the advantage of larger pick radius, meaning they can grab you from 5x  the distance you can, Good luck with those mini-games

Teammates are always fucking r*tarded in teamgames. I don't even know why they added team games when they are just not fun to play.

You fall over for no reason and people walk over you and you cannot get up even if all the people are gone you just lay on the floor contemplating your life choice and why you spend 20 euro on this fucking broken ass game",False
"I love the idea..10/10
I like the racing  maps
I don't like the BR mode so much...we have so many BR games these years
Also i don't like so much the team maps

My suggestion to the devs?Keep the BR mode,but make another one..a tournament mode,with no elimination and with points,for 10-20-30 players for example...like F1 style and of course only racing maps(more in future updates)

But i have to upvote the game,cause is a great idea..with the add of point tournament mode it will be perfect",True

"At first I was turned off by the way the game looked, I thought it was just going to be another battle royale elimination styled game but instead it's a fun play on mini games and it reminds me a lot of something you'd see at super mario party or something. The cosmetics in this game are amazing and instead of the game forcing you to chip in money everything so far that I have seen is earnable through the in game currency called kudos and when you win a game you get a crown which you can save up for other very rare cosmetics. The only issue I had personally had was the lag and getting disconnected from the game but other than that it's a solid game for both casual and competitive folks all around and yeah I feel like I'm babbling so im gonna end the review here 

pretty fun game 7/10",True
Fun game but can quickly become dry because a lot of the levels repeat with no new challenge. Developers should add new levels ASAP,True

A couple levels aren't as fun as they could/should be (Tip Toe), and I do with it felt a little more procedural/unique every time...maybe something that will happen more as the game is expanded and improved.

Overall, nice and polished for what it is, colorful and delightful to play.",True
"Fun game, great with friends. Server issues aside, it's a great fun party game ""even though it's modeled after BR games"". This is one everyone should check out. 

DON'T SLEEP ON THIS GAME! It's got a ton of potential. Just give it a chance. 

Graphics are great, fun, vibrant and fit the mood well. Game is frantic non-stop fun. Hug EVERYONE! 

Some things I think could be improved: 
- The cosmetics are great BUT...the patterns could be a bit more unique. The ""Kudos"" coins you get for in-game cosmetics are a bit too high in price for those if I'm being quite honest. 
- There needs to be some team-based modes. 
- Sometimes the grappling onto things is a little wonky but I am sure that can get a tweak or two over time. 

Besides that, there's not much wrong I can say about the game. Just jump in, have fun, laugh, cry....but most of all HUG and be number one!",True
"Fall Guys is a great mix of skill gameplay and pure luck. You must accept this coming in. It is a low stakes BR game where you take on 59 other players to try and win the crown. Gameplay consists of a jump, dive and grab mechanic and that is it. Games are inspired by wipeout, Takeshi's castle and MXC, with some team modes thrown into the rotation too. This game has a battle pass you get for free, earning coins for in game performance to unlock cosmetics as you go. Fall Guys is a fantastic and fun game that will make you scream and laugh out loud from your first round. It is worth the money and I look forward to where it goes from here.",True

"Amazing, love the pure panic of it all.",True
Servers as suggested in the title 10/10 for honesty,True
"I recommend this game for the funny idea alone. As many reviews already said, it's basically Takeshi's Castle but paired with silly looking charackters (which remind me of those tiny oval toy figures from my childhood with a weight in them, that can roll a bit forward if you hit them because the weight would roll from one end to the other, forgot their name)  and ragdoll. I found myself giggling over the weird situations that can happen in the game.

In the long run I can see this game becoming stale, I think in the long run it will develop into a game that will be played only occasionally. If things like Workshop or a map editor are added, I see the longlivety of the game way better.
The content question also exists, but more maps are promised, so we will see.

Negative are the microtransactions in the game for the ingame currency. That shouldn't be a thing. On the other hand the season passes are promised to be free. That would compensate the negative.

All in all it's just a game focusing on having fun, can't see much negative with it.",True
"Fantastic fun and a great game, plenty of replay value and a fresh take on the Battle Royale genre. Reminds me of a cross between Total Wipeout and Takeshi's Castle, absolutely brilliant. As it's Day One at the time of writing there are some small server and matchmaking issues that have caused a few entitled souls to review bomb this game in a negative light. Don't bother with any of them.",True

Its a fun game to play especially when you are playing with a squad. Most cosmetics are receivable with in-game money so thats a + aswell. Only bad thing is the server issues but i dont blame the developers for this because they could have never anticipated this many people playing their game and I am sure they will fix this problem as soon as possible.,True

- Simple controls
- Constant amusement
- Friends and group play

Things that need work:
- After a while you'll have played through a majority of content (which is good or bad depending on how familiar you want to be with the maps.)

This game is actually very simple to play but the physics of it are goofy enough to make for realistic debacles.  You feel like some guy running around in a goofy suit, and it's great.

The game makes it easy to laugh at yourself and your friends, and it's extremely rewarding when you do get to qualify for each consecutive round! I was cautiously optimistic when it was announced at E3 last year, and I am so happy to say that this game is everything it was shown to be, and more. The Fall Guys themselves are super stinking cute, and the outfits they wear are fun and inspired. I love that this game has such a wide audience that it appeals to! As an adult, I love it because I grew up watching MXC and Ninja Warrior; but I can 100% see parents allowing their children to play this game! The devs nailed the vibrant and upbeat aesthetic, and the music is catchy without the potential of getting annoying. I am so in love with this game, and so happy it is finally out.

Incredibly fun game that's seriously addictive. Can't wait to see what more they have in store for us!,True
"Great game.
Just from their discord you can tell that they care about how the game Is received and are looking for more ideas to keep the game fresh.
I hope that Devolver gets the servers up to full power.

"Played this game in Closed alpha during NDA and the rest of the betas they had. 
Super fun game and never laughed so much playing a game. 
I recommend this game and just dont care about the negative review bombing thats happening right now.


",True
"This game is a ton of fun. Its so simple, but exciting every time you play it. I've had the chance to play this with my community during the Beta and even during Beta, the game ran smoothly. Each new game will have its blips, but the developers want this game to succeed and so do I. It's massive multiplayer mode, unique obstacle courses, cosmetics and gameplay is new, fresh and fun. Not a lot of games like this out right now. Keep up the great work and looking forward to the future!",True
"Played this game in beta, it was a ton of fun. Lots of polish, creative gamemodes, overall a joy to play especially with friends. Future content has been confirmed - battle passes, new gamemodes, maps and such will all be free. 

If you're discouraged by the negative reviews, don't be. Most of them are by people who have never seen a multiplayer game launch day one.",True
"This game is a blast! Extremely addicting. It can be casual yet competitive. Gang Beasts meets Mario Party Meets Gary's Mod Deathrun/race. The graphics are simple yet enjoyable. Plenty of cool cosmetics and plenty to save up ""win"" tokens for.

I see a bright bright future for this game as long as the developers keep an open mind to community suggestions and continue to support it through consistent updates. (Luckily they have already shared a small roadmap)

I will note the launch has been a bit rough because more people than they expected are trying to play but I don't feel this should count against them.",True
"Very nice game! Super funny, especially with friends. :) Worked perfectly in the morning, so no need to be that rude and especially no need to write a bad review instantly!",True
Despite the downtime of servers due to high population the game is pretty fun!,True
"This is a really cute and fun game. I really like the minigames and it makes it much better playing with friends. Everyone that is complaining about service problems should not buy games from steam anymore. Just because a game has a rough start, does not mean that you have to rate the game negatively.",True
"Super fun game, even better with mates. Ignore the server issues on launch, they'll get fixed! Definitely worth your time!",True
10/10 game but will leave you shouting at your screen,True
"I feel I need to post this as the game's reviews have now fallen to ""Mixed"".
I played 13 hours of the beta, and it is the first Battle Royale-esque game that is genuinely fun.
It is $20 so the price is fair. It is easy to hop on play whenever. The only complaint from people that is understandable is the servers, which they are already trying to fix.",True
"quite good fun... when it works...
on day of release the servers are completely swamped.. so far I've lost a few rounds worth of rewards because server failed after winning/second place - jumping for crown on one round I bounced off the crown?!

game needs to be able to support bigger lobbies of friends though... 4 just isn't enough for this type of game",True
"I´ve played a lot in the beta and won some games.

The game is glitchy and it should have been more polished in the release, but otherwise the game is good, it´s light hearted fun but if it doesnt get cross platform support i think it may wither soon. It´s kind of repetitive after a while and there is really not too much to learn, the learning curve is fast enough and you can get good at the game in only a few hours.

Some of the games are really RNG based and TEAM GAMES ARE NOT GOOD, THEY SHOULD TAKE THEM OFF OR MAKE ANOTHER GAMEMODE WITHOUT THEM, and im not the only one having this issue.

I´ve won 3 times in the beta, but every fucking time i get a team minigame i know i will lose, i lost more than 20 team minigames while only having played like 27, and the matches i won were the ones with only individual minigames.",True
"So far, I've been enjoying the game. Not bored of it yet but I'm leaving it for a little while until the servers are fixed. I managed to play earlier this morning and the amount of games I managed to play without any issues was great. I was getting into games really quickly, had full matches and no disconnects.

Now though, it seems at least 10 people get disconnected straight away and a few more throughout the rounds. I've been disconnected once during a game and once after I had lost a game, both times the XP rewards weren't counted. Not having the rewards doesn't concern me too much, unless you actually win a game to get a crown. The devs have mentioned that they're trying to cope with the server demand, so probably in a weeks time when everyone isn't trying to play it at once, the connection issues will at least be less of an issue. My main issue is trying to get into a game, since I'll get a message once a match is over that I've been disconnected, then it takes a while (or soft locks) to go back to the main menu. The first two or three times I search for a match after that, I get disconnected during match making and eventually it does work but it can take a while.

Pretty much all of the free for all modes are great, with the exception of the catch the tail final round and the team games. Being paired up with people who are either really good or really bad doesn't bother me too much, but there's a certain jankyness to the game, where I'm directly behind someone trying to get their tail and others just seem to be able to grab the tail when they're not even close to me/someone. Some of the ""free"" physics objects like the footballs and the eggs in egg hunt also have some strange jank and stuttering to them that makes them more difficult to control. The football team game can be pretty fun, but it's been a complete stomp both times I've played it. One time, the yellows only had 5 players and blue had 6, so it would be nice if these game modes at the very least could be fixed up so they're always equal and to smooth out the janky physics I mentioned earlier.

The obstacle courses are great fun and the main appeal of the game. The devs will probably add new game modes in the future, but hopefully, they'll add a few obstacle maps with every update they do. 

Content wise, there's not a lot on offer at the moment and it really just does depend on how much you can enjoy a game where each round is short (2 minutes is usually the longest it takes due to timed challenges) and a full match can last about 20 minutes if you make it right to the end. It might just be my experience but I've played Whirlywig so many times and only played the door crashers level twice, so there may well be an issue of getting bored with the game quickly if you're unlucky enough to be put onto the same maps every game. 

I kind of recommend Fall Guys. It's a good base that can be built on, but for now the connection issues and the janky game modes I mentioned earlier just make it annoying to play. I'd recommend waiting a few weeks just to see if these issues get sorted out by then.",True
Great game to play with friends!,True

"[h1] ONE MAJOR ISSUE [/h1]

[b] I have been playing ish two hours, found only five matches. The major issue is the playerbase, there are too few playing which leads to lots of waiting time in the searching zone.

This game is best described as a platforming  battle royale  gameshow that is so much fun to play. Even in defeat I still have fun and keep coming back for more because this is the most enjoyment from a video game I've had in so long. Highly Recommended !! Do yourself a favor and pick it up.,True
"Great game, lots of silly fun to be had here, from grabbing other people to booping them off ledges this game is the perfect way to get a cheesy grin.

So far I didn't play the game much I've played the beta a lot it was very fun in the beta and I bought the game and won my first game that was very nice! but in this review we are going over the cons and pros. I hope they add some sort of custom lobbies for streamers / players to have fun with specific people! So far am I in love with this game! 

[b] Cons [/b]
- Few Bugs some are really annoying ( But can easily be fixed )
- Team games are fun can be fairly unbalanced ( Always will be like this until some sort of ranking )

[b] Pros [/b]
- Game runs smooth as hell obviously expected but still can be mentioned!
- It's very fun and attractive to play
- a BR that doesn't contain shooting element
- Lot's of fun and anger moments will be accured especially playing with friends :)

I would rate this game an solid 9 out of 10

"Played a couple rounds. Had a poppin' discord ready to play together.
Max party size is 4 which is pretty lame.

Fun, but party size should be increased.",True
Remove team games. Have nothing to do with skill nor are fun. If I wanted to see if I would lose by luck I would flip a coin not painstakingly wait a whole round to be told no you lost as you didn't have as many on your team and you had no impact. Rest of the game is amazing and a hell of a lot of fun I love it to pieces and would play this everyday if team games were gone. Till then Thumbs down.,False
Hackers in every other game,False
"Losing it's appeal after a couple of hours due to lack of games, and some of the games not being enjoyable. Should be free to play, $20 is a bit steep for this amount of content with a cosmetic shop",False
"I can't get on with this game so far. It's a great start, but there's not enough variety of content to keep me interested. There's also a little too much RNG and not enough rewarding for skill.
A great first improvement would be to allow us to opt out of team based minigames. There's nothing fun or interesting about being eliminated because RNG puts you on the losing team. Often people go afk or quit as soon as their team loses the lead and there's nothing to compensate for it.
I'd personally like to see the grab mechanic turned off outside of minigames that require it. I've come across so many players that grab someone to stop them qualifying and stop themselves from qualifying too.
Just as frustrating is being eliminated from a minigame because of another player trying to cuddle the bumpers and being launched in to you.

Hope this gets better!",False

When the game was launched, it was so lagging that my tail got stolen and lost the game , gg :(
I don't see any server for each country. it would be more comfortable to play if there is no lag in the game as it is a massively multiplayer game .
For me about the currency of this game is $7 ( in Indian region ) , i saw the normal price is $19.99 which is pretty not worth it so be wise before you buy , thanks !!",True

"Real fun game at the start, but absolutely PLAGUED with hackers now. You literally cannot have fun anymore.

It should be a game you can come online to play for fun and chill out, but I've played 7 games today, and in 4 of those games were hackers. That's over 50%!!!! Absolutely shocking. The developers really need to address this more seriously and fast before the game dies.

All in all, a real shame. If you want this game, get it on PS4, there's no hackers there (literally seen none, level 37 there) but on PC/Steam it's disgusting.",False

is there literally ANY challenge here besides memory that doesn't suck?,False
A battle royale where it's fun to lose. I don't know how they did it but the jumping jellybeans made losing fun.,True
"Where to begin, I like the game at least the Free-For-All modes are an absolute blast. Team games on the other hand are boring and more of a lottery on whether or not you're getting a team that A) Has the same amount of players the other team has B) Not having a garbage team. If this game wants to be successful in the long run focus on FFA modes as those are  where this game shines.

Cheaters are becoming a bigger issue as the days go on, (IF you use cheats in a game like this you must live one sad life) so hopefully this gets resolved or QoL is going to deteriorate.

Speaking of QoL not sure how this game is going to do in the coming months or even in the next few weeks. Sure it's gotten tons of traction now but in order to keep people interested in this you're going to need to keep this game fresh and have a reason for people to come back.

For now I'll recommend the game but still a lot of questions regarding if the popularity continues in the long run for this game or if it'll be a waste of $30 in a month or so. Only time will tell.",True
"EDIT: Except the patch meant to fix team games and outfit visual issues haven't actually fixed anything as far as I'm aware. Now it's just principle, stay away from this game. I can forgive a slightly rocky launch in terms of server stability. I can forgive bugs and crashes being present when things are actually done to fix them. But now we're presented with patches that don't do what they claim they do, coming in way later than I would have liked. If this is the best they can do, I am not impressed.

EDIT: [strike]A patch has now gone out with a number of fixes. Team games can now only happen if teams are even, which is very helpful. 4v5 in Fall Ball is a big deal, and I'm happy that can't occur anymore. I appreciate this. I will have to play and explore just how much was fixed.[/strike]

EDIT: I'm rewording this to sound less angry. Most (If not all?) of these issues are still not fixed almost 2.5 weeks after launch, which is moving from unacceptable to utterly inexcusable. I still like the game. It's fun, it's cute, and I love the concept. They need to get on the ball and fix some of this, at least, and I hope they do. It's a good game currently marred by these issues. I mean, the keyboard input thing is game breaking, even. Original conclusion stands; Wait to see how they will support the game post launch. Hopefully, they will.

Original review;
The more I play this, the less I can look past some of the issues. I don't understand how a game that underwent beta testing could have released 1.0 with some of these issues.

Including, but not limited to,
Mouse cursor always being visible even when playing mouse/keyboard and using it to control the camera.
Games that just aren't fun and lead to the already losing team being bullied into losing harder.
Egg Scramble, for example, ends up being a clusterfuck. It's almost better to focus on stealing rather than collecting, the weird latency and grab mechanics just plain make it worse. Why do you drop the egg forward when you get grabbed? Surely you should drop it backward? And as a whole this particular game would be better if a collected egg is a point, end of. Have some way that adds new eggs to the center arena and make it a collecting game rather than a hoarding/bullying one.
Rock 'N' Roll is another dumb game. One single bean can easily roll the ball up the hill when 4-5 beans are trying to roll it down towards the goal, and two beans can completely trap the ball in a corner. How does that make any kind of sense?
There are issues with the Hex-a-Gone final and the Tiptoe game that make some people just randomly ping off, because of wonky framerate related physics.
There are only a dozen or so games in the first place. Give it 3-4 hours and you've seen everything there is to do. Give it another 3-4 hours, and you'll know the best ways to play each map.
Sometimes, when hitting escape to leave a game, the game then switches to the elimination grid screen and no longer listens to any keyboard input whatsoever until restarted.
They didn't sanitize player names, leading to disabling them completely as a temporary fix. Input sanitization is a pretty big deal.
The in-game store had the same rotation for all players up until today, as I've understood it. Before today, if you had X costume in the store, 80% of beans was wearing that costume.

This is by no means an exhaustive list. The more I play the less I can look past some of these things. It boggles my mind how some these were present through the closed testing and still made it into 1.0.",False

Nice,True
"The anti-cheat works great. I have seen zero or maybe 1 cheater. This guy only seemed to activate it 0.1 seconds before the round ended. Other than that one suspicious encounter that might have just been lag, the game is now great to play on PC. The game runs great on a 1660Super. Needs more game modes.",True
"This shit is so silly,  I love it.",True
"Absolutely entertaining game, tons of fun. But the thing that ruins it are cheaters in almost every match you play.
Like who on earth thinks that cheating in such game like Fall Guys is fun. It ruins fun for anyone else who's trying to get to finish. I feel with everyone who tried to play and have fun innocently, but all they see are flying cheaters all over a map.

I will change my review accordingly once this problem with cheaters will be somehow handled.

Oh but geuss what ? Would you like them ? No! Go fuck yourself hahahah xd.

Very fucking funny. The Developer puts amazing costumes in the game but then tells you that you cannot have them unless you win 10 times to get 10 fucking crows, that's how much you have to pay to buy the whole thing.

"Super fun to play with friends. Lot of varied and fun levels. Only few things me and my friends have issues with are:
1. There is hardly any significance of a party
2. The generic character name makes it difficult to spot/spectate party members especially since the game doesn't auto focus on our party members' characters. (I think they are making some changes to this)
3. The loading screen get super boring especially if you are playing when there are less players on the server. I hope they can add some mini game or something or some sandbox mode like other games like Rocket League have.

Fall Guys is a very laid back yet fiery game all at once to ensure players feel a great sense of relaxation as well as competitive spirit.

"I *really* want to enjoy this game, but unfortunately there are a large number of minigames which require the player to interact with other players or physics objects, from south-africa we connect through to servers in EU & USA which leads to a high latency.

In minigames like soccer, your character will just phase through the ball without effecting it.
In tail grab, interacting with a player will show the icon of you grabbing a player, but not actually grabbing them and stealing the tail.
In the ""curse"" gamemode, interacting with a player rarely curses them as they are not actually 'there'
in the final minigame 'crown grab' good luck grabbing a floating, moving crown when it's a half-second ahead of where you see it.

The game FAQ says ""worldwide"" servers, but my router, firewall & latency all say the nearest game server to South Africa is in Germany which is ~300ms / 9000km away.
Imagine being in Europe and being forced to connect to a server hosted on the west coast of the USA, it's roughly the same distance.

Suggestion to add South African servers has been ignored on Discord, Reddit, Twitter & Email support.",False
Best Battle Royale game !,True
"The 'Infallible' achievement needs to be changed/removed. This is the achievement for winning 5 matches in a ROW. It is the single biggest contributor to rampant cheating in this game and the devs refuse to acknowledge it.

Additionally the devs decided that instead of fixing the name exploit, it would be better to just make everyone anonymous. Further leading to even more cheating with no plans to fix the naming exploit. They've removed the ability to report players from their discord and are saying to just trust their obviously VERY defective anti-cheat.

I do not recommend this game to ANYONE until the devs get their act together. As much as I want more levels and skins, the game is nigh unplayable at the moment.",False

"The game is fun until you've done everything a good amount of times, unfortunately it consistently needs new content updates to keep the game fresh as it's a 'live service' game, and they added Easy Anti-Cheat instead of having server-side checks, bloating the game on the consumer's end needlessly, and unintentionally breaking Proton compatibility so MacOS or Linux users can no longer play the game.

Avoid this FOTM garbage.",False
"Easy Anti-Cheat ruins this game. Cannot recommend a game that forces you to run a kernel-level anticheat to play. Shame on you, developers.

The timing of this is curious too. Like DOOM Eternal, it was added aftermarket and it is an invasive anticheat. Regardless of whether this was out of any kind of malicious intent or simply the developers not realising that adding such a questionable Anti-Cheat solution over a month after a game's release is pretty anti-consumer, both are equally as bad.

I've requested a refund for this game. This is one of the very few instances where I would emplore you to play on a console instead.",False
"Developers introduced Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) that completely ruined the support for the game on Linux. It worked great trough Proton, however there's no way to play the game if you're a Linux user currently.

Not to mention that the developers have for the most part remained very silent on Linux support for a long time before the update, and the few responses that they have given were sketchy and concerning at best.",False
"CONTENT CONTENT CONTENT

The concept of this game is brilliant. I used to watch Wipeout on TV and this is basically the digital equivalent of it + battle royale.

However, this game needs way more CONTENT. Especially in the early game (when there are still 60 to 40 people remaining). I've only played about 2 hours and the levels are already getting really stale. It's the same few being rotated over and over: Gate Crash, See Saw, Door Dash anyone? At this point, they need to hire way more level designers and pump out content like it's nobody's business.

Would I recommend this game at $20 for the content currently included? Nope. If it had double or triple the current levels, sure. I'll revise my review then.",False

If cheaters annoy you don't play this game. Designers seem to be doing nothing to address the issue.

Game would be quite enjoyable but minimum every third game seems to have a cheater / hacker who makes playing this game pointless.,False
"I'll start this review off by saying that you won't be able to play this game without smiling at some point it's that fun. Inspired by a game show called Takeshi's castle that I used to enjoy watching, Fall Guys is an enjoyable battle-royale with lots fun levels and stages that wont make losing feel like a chore. There are also team modes that are extremely fun but limit your chances of winning due to the team's performance. The battle pass is completely free and you can customize your Fall Guy from the daily store. Cheaters exist but with a kick-ass development team that are working tirelessly pumping out new content the cheaters wont be long lived. I see a very bright future for this game.

Honestly it's so bad that if I hadn't had my 2 hours gone already I would have refunded the game and quite happily never touched it again. Get it on PS4, or, don't get it.

this game has big potential to have fun with family member.

it's ok if not support family share but if Developer can add split screen in future (just like Rocket League) it will be great.

",True
"The good;
Extremely goofy physics and adds to the character of the game.
Has some replay ability although amount of stages is currently low and it feels repetitive after a few hours of game play.
Fun for the most part very basic platformer 
Graphics add to the character of the game, as good as they possibly could be for this style
Controller support is flawless

The reason I can't recommend it;

Hackers.
Dev's claim on social media that hackers are removed after one game, however seen multiple times hackers flying around in items requiring wins, meaning this is either a false claim or one the truth is being stretched or you could believe that someone has one legitimately and then randomly decided to hack, make up your own mind.
You might only have one hacker flying around in your game out of 60 people however this nullifies the entire game as they're guaranteed to win, so any argument of ""you only see 10 hackers in 10 games that's 10 bad beans out of 600"" is completely redundant.

Latency is horrendous and it's noticeable on certain game modes when you're grabbed from 14 ft away by 12 inch arms and then ragdoll like oblivion.

Overall the game is great fun and would be recommended if the game wasn't plagued by the issues above. It also suffers majorly from being a very basic platformer being carried by the fact it's online and preys on the psychology of winning to add replay value like battle royale rather than gameplay holding up. Will be dropping this for now sadly but will monitor it.",False

"Honestly, the best part of this game is that there's nothing to learn. You just play it and know what's happening immediately. Once you get used to the physics the only thing stopping you from success is RNG - Which leaves the game pretty addictive. While some games would leave you salty over losing over some sort of BS, the entire nature of this game is BS. As result all you can do is say ""Well, that was stupid,"" and hit play again. Why wouldn't you?

Plus it's the perfect side game. You can launch it, play a match or two, exit and do something else without consequence. The longevity doesn't come from the content so much as actual replayability, which is fairly rare these days.

Is it worth the price? I didn't think so at first, but now I'm pretty convinced on it. It's the perfect way to burn 10 minutes (or hours) when you're bored and can't figure out something else to do. I've spent more on games I've played less. If you're hesitating, nah. Go for it. While there are some DLC costumes and microtransactions for currency, they're incredibly optional considering how many coins the game just throws at you. If you can't afford something you will in just a couple shows.

It's a practice in non-consequential gameplay, which is incredibly alluring in a space filled with hardcore competition. Also you can dress up your jellybean - I mean, playing dress up is the entire reason to play video games to begin with.",True

"Recently, many games have had a focus on trying to make themselves the whole package. Amazing soundtrack, graphics, writing, etc... many focus and succeed in those aspects but forget the core part of the game which is to be enjoyable.

Fall Guys isn't trying to have the have the best graphics, doesn't even have a story, and it's OST isn't anything insane. It's incredibly fun though, and I think that's really what counts.

Notes: Currently (8/8/20) the game has many connection errors and server downages, but I think these'll get fixed in due time and are just due to an overload of players. Doesn't deter from the experience itself and I'm sure it'll be fixed soon. There are not that many minigames, but they're mostly fun and the developers have said they'll add more later on (still in Season 1).

"Fall Guys is the Mario party that PC needed. 

Despite only having 10 hours into the game and the server issues caused by launch (which I totally understand, devs should be proud) this game really is something that has alot of potential [b]IF[/b] they keep the game frequently updated.

Some gamemodes do need a rework. Team gamemodes are hit or miss depending on your teammates but thats fine imo. Tail game really depends on your connection to the server and should not be a final round one. They should always be skill gamemodes and no RNG ones.

They already confirmed alot of these on reddit but this game [b]NEEDS[/b] custom map editor otherwise it will start to get blend. 

Yes new official gamemodes will be added but it needs the community aspect, idk how they will implement them due to crossplay on ps4 and stuff (because consoles dont have steam workshop maps) but they can do it like trackmania does, add maps to the game and let the community vote for them which ones they want official or something.

The way the shop works is really awesome and I like the model. The free battlepas is awesome, but I guess we should wait for season 2 to see if they will go the paid route or if they keep the free route.

Best Fucking Game Ever. imagine being a bean. but not a xanax bean. a mighty bean. those toys from the early 2000's and imagine your playing wipeout. bing bang boom. fallguys.,True
"I want to love this game but there's some glaring issues gameplay wise. At the time of writing there are server issues but those are unintentional and not part of this review.

tldr: Team games bad. Put team games in own category/playlist.

Problems:

1. Team games are the worst. You play one every episode and they act as the big eliminator that removes half the players. None of them are fun and are a serious drawback to an otherwise fun game. I've been loathing playing because of the forced/guaranteed team game. They last way too long and are always centered around some objective that is glitchy at best (The soccer balls physics go in any which direction it feels like. The eggs are randomly flung when grabbed and you get knocked over because of random latency. The tail team game goes of for what feels like eons and is so bad that people can grab your tail from 2 meters away.) 

Its really annoying to get really far by skill/chance to then have your chances slashed because your team cant figure out how to put eggs in a basket or jump through a hoop properly. 

[u][b]Please move team games to its own category/playlist or something. I would look past the other issues/change my review if I never had to play a game of grab the tail again. [/b][/u]

Remember Lucioball in Overwatch? Remember how nobody like it? Imagine having to play a round of Lucioball between rounds in Overwatch before getting back to the game. Imagine losing the whole match because you lost a round a Lucioball in the game that you were otherwise winning.

2. Some of the solo runs are bad too. The Seesaw one can put you on a different checkpoint then you started and away from the crowd, but the seesaw is too high in the air to progress because of the mob on the other side holding it down. Starting in the front will sometimes give an unfair advantage especially on the seesaw one or the rising slime run. It would be better if you had some sort of invisible wall that people could crowd around and have an equal chance of getting out in front.

3. Having to sit through the loading and intro of the next stage after being eliminated is the most infuriating thing that I cannot believe that the devs didn't change prior to release. 

4. There aren't a lot of stages yet, so its hard to justify the price at the moment. I wont hold it against the game for it however as they have planned to release more stages as they go.

Overall the game is 9/10 when its fun, but absolutely infuriating to the point where I stop playing when its not.

------------

Just some suggestions.

The friend/party system could use some improvements. How about highlighting your friend so you can see them and when you are eliminated early/finish sooner have your spectate camera jump to someone in your party rather than some random.

I'd love to be able to play in a private game with friends. Just you and 4-8 others in a lobby would be amazing. Drinking games could be a blast.

The elimination screen could have the pinboard below actually do something. Maybe for bonus fame or something if your guy is lucky enough to fall in a winning slot. Maybe a chance at a crown the more challenges you completed before getting eliminated.

Literally every match I've played has been a 60 man swf recently. Which I would have no problem if it weren't for the body blocking the grabbing the jumping ECT. Like when I play now and in the lobby I look at the players im playing again and the moment 3 or 4 fall guys all pop in together with gordon freeman skins I already know I'm not going to have a fun game and what do you know I get no crown or tails.,True

The servers are buggy, the mouse shows up on screen when playing with KB+M, it takes ages to get out of spectating after you die and sometimes it doesn't even let you out until you quit the game.... I could go on, but the actual gameplay is too good. I seriously recommend playing this game, especially when they fix all of the issues.

"Really fun game to play, especially with a few other friends. There is definitely some buggy-ness with the servers, but that is just due to an unexpected number of players during the first day or so, and it never prevented me from playing the game and it didn't ruin my experience.

I do wish that they would extend the pre-made lobby count from 4 to say 6 or 7, especially since the game has a 60-player-per-lobby requirement anyways. I would be surprised if this caused people to abuse it and team up, since only one person can get the big reward at the end anyways.

I think for the game to have serious longevity either the developers need to be very dedicated to releasing new content on the regular, or (better in my opinion) release map and gamemode creation tools to the community so that it can be done for them at a higher pace. I also think that community-run servers should be in the game's future, because they would be a good way of judging the quality of maps and gamemodes, ultimately leading to their inclusion in the base game on official servers.

Either way, I think the game is seriously fun. I do think though that the developers need to have a solid plan for the future of this game if they want to continue riding the wave that they've built up so far.",True

"At the moment, Fall Guys just doesn't have the variety necessary to keep me personally engaged. The game is adorable and absolutely has the potential to be amazing. However, there are a few sore spots that need to be addressed before I consider returning to the game.

We'll start with Pros as I'm sure most people share a similar opinion here.

The gameplay itself is fun and silly AT FIRST; it's everything I expected it to be based on the prerelease coverage of the game.

The aesthetic matches the gameplay with it's bright colors and cute characters. 

The minigames that have been released are largely well designed and easy to understand.

Now for the Cons.

I mentioned before that the gameplay was fun AT FIRST - here's why.
Fall Guys, at the time of writing this, has ~15 minigames. Of the matches I played; most games made it to round 6. There are no repeat minigames per session. Each game lasts around 1.5 - 2 minutes. With this in mind, let's say 12 people out of 60 make it to the 6th round. Those 12 people have already been exposed to 40% of what the game has to offer currently. in 10-15 minutes 40% of the game has been played by 1/6th of the lobby.

The current player limit in a squad is 4 which simply isn't high enough. Worse still; if anyone is knocked out of the game early, they can either leave the game and requeue solo or, watch the remaining players/friends continue through the rounds. Either a loser's bracket or maybe a small open playground for early knock-outs to play in would solve this.

I will happily edit this review and return to the game after these sore spots are addressed. Given the games that Devolver Digital have published in the past, I am confident that things will change for the better in time. Until then - those considering pick Fall Guys understand that there isn't much to the game at the moment.",False
"Takeshi's castle, it's fun.",True
"Do not review bomb the bean.

They weren't expecting so many players on day one. To go from pigeon dating VN to ""Oh god there's too many players for our multiplayer game"" is kinda expected. Besides how many games have smooth multiplayer as soon as they release.

As for the game it's very fun.",True
"This is one of the earliest reviews I have given, but well deserved.

This. Game. Is. Awesome.

If the battle royale genre and the TV show Wipeout had a baby, I give you, Fall Guys.

This game is sheer fun, mini-game after mini-game of proving how skillful and lucky you are, with a colorful environment, wide variety of cosmetics, and party mode to cheer each other on!

Finally, a battle royale game that isn't: ""Drop into the big map and shoot each other.""
And one of the few (if there are even any other) multiplayer obstacle course games on Steam.

The devs have said this is just the beginning, and they plan to add so much more.

This game is so popular that we brought down the servers, lol. It's a small team, but they're hard at work getting it back up.

Looking forward to hopping right back in as soon as the servers are back up!

See you at the finish line! Let's get that crown! =D",True

25 maps/game-modes is enough content for launch day, people claiming it's repetitive clearly never played a battle royale before, and they do have plans on adding more stuff as time goes.
As far as pricetags go I've seen  way worse games for this price, and this is absolutely great fun, good to play by yourself and even better with friends.
The silly nature of the game was its charm for me and it works out great.",True
Feel like showing your friends that you are the undisputed champion at smashing your face against doors fastest? This game is for you!,True
"I played in the beta. Trust me, this game is worth the wait. Everything in at launch EASILY justifies $20 and they plan on adding more!

"As someone who has never become involved in the battle royale genre, I have to admit I'm having a lot of fun with this game so far. If you've ever watched Takeshi's Castle, you'll have a general idea of what to expect from this game. You and up to 59 other players take part in increasingly difficult physics-based challenges and fight to be the last one standing. Whilst being incredibly simple with really only three different buttons and the control stick to utilize, Fall Guys finds numerous ways to iterate on this basic toolset with mostly excellent results. 

Certain challenges such as the fruit memorization one are a bit boring, mostly because it's too easy to the point where barely anyone gets eliminated, but the vast majority within the game are fun to play multiple times over. Additionally, the difficulty of all challenges increases as you progress through the rounds, so even if you play the same challenge in two separate games, there may be a slight change in difficulty if you encounter a challenge later in the game to when you previously encountered it.

In terms of progression and monetization, I believe the game handles this very fairly. For the price of entry, you will have access to all future battle passes for free as opposed to having to pay every time a new season rolls around. There are microtransactions to buy cosmetic currency, but they can be completely ignored. Playing better in this game, meaning getting to the later rounds and finishing before the majority in races, gets you more currency, and so the better you are, the faster you'll be able to buy cosmetics and progress through the season. You cannot purchase the secondary crown currency or speed up the battle pass, so really, the only way to get the battle pass and crown unlocks is to play well.

Whether you will think the game is worth it depends on if the core loop seems appealing to you. At this price, I would highly recommend it if you want to play a game that is more focused on having fun rather than being highly competitive and progression focused. I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun I was having with this game pre-release and now, and maybe you will be too.

Note - This is a game you should use a controller to play. The game has full controller support and works flawlessly with my nintendo switch pro controller.",True

"This game cured my depression which I had been struggling with for years. For the first time in forever, I have been able to smile again. My brother is finally talking to me and my mom said she loves me for the first time since my dad left. I lost 50lbs and my job and couldn't be happier. Thank you Fall Guys for changing my life.",True
"A simple and fun concept marred by a greedy cash shop and some frustrating game modes. I would ignore the launch day bugs. While not really forgivable, it's understandable that the game is struggling to keep up. Give it a week and the population should level out. I've also played a lot in the beta so I feel my review is justified. 

The cash shop is a problem. This is not a free to play game. The cash shop has high prices, grinding the currency is inconvenient (intentionally of course), and the game rotates the items you can buy to ""encourage"" you to log in over multiple hours rather than picking what you want. I hate this sort of thing in f2p titles, but this is just embarrassing. 

The game itself is enjoyable for a bit. I haven't laughed at a game in a while so it was a pleasant surprise. That said, the team game modes are incredibly frustrating. I'm not opposed in principle, and some games (like the boulder roll) are enjoyable. However, the lack of ability to communicate means that the one player on your team who doesn't understand the game will cause you to lose, or one troll, with no way of explaining to them how to play. For example; all it takes is one player to run against your ball in the boulder roll and you practically insta-lose. I think the team games should be moved so that they always populate the first and second rounds, but are left out of the last 3. It's just too frustrating to lose after a good run because of unlucky teams. 

The ball physics are also a bit wonky, and some games are unbalanced due to this. The soccer game is particularly bad, as a player can headbutt the ball into the opposite goal high enough that the other team cannot block it. This takes skill, but there is also no counterplay beyond camping the ball and grabbing said player. Of course, no comms means your team may not even understand this, so you must sacrifice doing literally anything else just to prevent the sweep. There are often too many things for to do with no way of assigning or explaining tasks. 

I'm going to briefly run down the final-round games, as these are the most important to me. 

Fall mountain is a short obstacle course where your success is determined by two things 
1) learn how to do the course without messing up
2) getting lucky and spawning at the front edges
This game is bad. The course isn't that difficult and there is no way to throw off the competition.

TNT Run (i don't know the name) is amazing. Obviously this game exists in other forms (minecraft), but the implementation here is good. Nothing to say other than you can occasionally be rocketed away by other players. A consequence of the physics, but it would be nice to see it fixed. 

The tail catching game is also good. There's some rng as to whether you start with the tail, but there's enough room for outplays regardless. I wish there was more than one map (applies to all). 

I'd finally like to say that the obstacle courses, especially the rising lava (goo) one, are the highlight of the game, and they should strongly focus on providing more of these. Perhaps a custom level editor or a playlist for only obstacle courses is in order. I'll never change my review to a positive one unless they remove the cash shop or make the game f2p, but I'll recommend it in the future if the devs show any signs of listening to feedback. 

Other final note: This game is certainly getting review-bombed due to the poor launch, but that does not invalidate negative reviews. Dismissing criticism of the game just because you want it to succeed will inevitably cause it to fail.",False

The solo challenges are fun but the team games are HORRIBLE. At one point it put us into a unbalanced game of soccer/football with only 9 people.,False
"The $20 price tag is a lie. You actually need to spend an extra $30 or $40 at least for internet speeds because out of any multiplayer game I have ever played, Fall Guys has the WORST latency issues BY FAR

Many of the minigame modes are completely broken because of awful physics (especially Egg Scramble and Fall Ball). Honestly the developers seem incompetent because they don't want to admit they're wrong about some of their gamemodes being downright broken and terribly created which causes gamemodes that ruin the other perfect maps and drag the entire game down

Lastly, hackers. To Mediatonic's credit they're a new company that didn't expect their game to blow up so fast. The biggest red flag is WHY WOULD YOU ALIENATE YOUR PLAYER BASE AND COMMUNITY by telling everyone ""Oh yeah hackers you see play their first and last game there's no need to report them"". What a spit in the face to people who care about their game

You hear those stories about people in companies that get fucked over because of betrayal of other people and end up with nothing? Fall Guys is a simulator of that feeling because of how many rightful crowns I've been robbed of (and seen other people robbed of theirs) due to the game's and Mediatonic's faults

If anyone from Mediatonic is reading this, please take these critiques into account. You have something truly special and it would be devastating if Fall Guys did not live up to its potential",False

"Do I even need to do this? It's Fall Guys, man. Need I say more?

Just kidding, lol. Drop People: Moderate Tournament is a up to 60 man battle royale of sorts, consisting of silly and fun party games where even losing is funny. Jumping across the spinning beams and ducking under the fat top beams in a Wipeout-kinda style, avoiding the swinging wrecking balls and donut-covered poles as you run up the slime ramp, playing human football, hoarding eggs from other teams, memorizing the fruit squares to stand on the right ones, running across the tilting see-saws in complete pandemonium, and of course, running up Fall Mountain to grab the crown yourself. Skydive Gamers: Conclusive Stunner has it all, and more, plenty more. There isn't TOO much to say about Descend Jellybeans: Superior Elimination, but there isn't much that NEEDS to be said. Plunge Gentlemen: Above-Average Coup-De-Grace is a hilariously goofy and silly battle royale that is very easy to get good at and start collecting crowns on, in my opinion. Its a battle royale you can actually relax with and virtually always have fun with, unlike most other ones, due to it hardly being what I would call ""competitive"", compared to others like Apex and COD Warzone, etc. Gravity-Afllicted Persons with XY Chromosomes: Decent Competition is an absolutely incredible game. It looks so simple and goofy, and it is, and THAT'S what makes it great. It's constant fun and hilarity that will keep you coming back for more and more. The random game modes keep you on your toes with an almost-certain promise of fun every time. Again, it's fun even if you lose, which you will a lot, its a battle royale. Anyways. I absolutely love this game, and you will too! Give Skydive Gamers a try if you can, you won't regret it! And, you dont need anything extra to play Skydive Gamers, like a plugin or some third party account or anything. Just get it and jump right into the fun straight from the get-go!

NOTE: Skydive Gamers is unfortunately starting to get a hacker problem. Rarely, but not never, in some matches you will see someone with low gravity, or most commonly, someone floating in place above the ground where they can bypass the entire course or never be touched. This is a big pain, but luckily it's still rare, far more than enough that you will barely ever see it, so its still easy to have a fair, fun game. IF YOU HACK NEWTON-INFLUENCED MALES: STOP, YOU ARE RUINING IT FOR THE REST OF US.

(also ngl you're quite a sad specimen if you hack this game of all things. Get a life, man. Sorry, had to put that in here. Everyone hates hackers, and you don't need to hack in any way to win.)

Be warned this game can make you rage but thats what it is designed to do basically it gives you a challenge though!

"Not worth the 20€. 

Pro:
-Unique Game, its the only Battle royale game with this Idea (im sure this will change very fast in the future)
-Funny minigames (e.g. football, parkour levels)


Neutral: -Big variety of skins (most skins have unfair prices, that costs 5 Crowns, Crowns you can only get from winning the game)


Contra:
-Only a few minigames, I played 1 hour and I played every minigame twice or more
-Game decides what Resolution, you will play on there is no way to change it 
-Awful soundtrack 
-Cheaters, that have 200% moving speed
-Very repetitive
-Clumpy/Buggy Controls
-A lot of Bugs (some even force you to reboot your computer)
-Server Crashes (3/5 games Crashed in the middle of the game)
-Game connects you to already full games so you can just spectate


Conclusion: In the current state of the game I cant recommend this game. 
If the game would be marked as an early access title with a price of like 5€ it would be ok, but for 20€ it really isnt worth it.


I hope this review could help you, decide if this game is a good Choice for youself !

Edit : I gave the Game a second chance, also tried to change the resolution,but everytime I  changed my resolution via other programms (e.g. Nvidia Geforce Experience) the game just resets it.",False

Great Game but servers are bad,True
Three days in a row the servers have been down during my only opportunities to play. I waited for the scheduled maintenance and got into two game after that but then the servers started dying again.

"Full of cheaters, beware.

Servers keep dropping, disconnecting all players. RNG based rounds with everyone bodyblocking you and you can get chainstunned out of a round.

Not fun at all and a waste of time. It's like throwing a dice. Zero skill involved.",False
"Honestly it's a great game, but it has a major hacker problem. Almost every other match has a hacker, and it completely ruins the game. Worst of all, there is no reporting feature, so even after somebody hacks there's no way to report them in-game. They really need to fix this problem because otherwise, this game will have an incredibly short lifespan. My breaking point was when I reached the final round and it was down to me and one other player who was a hacker, which ended up costing me an otherwise definite win and crown. Extremely infuriating.",False
"It does genuinely make me sad to give it this review, since this game has the potential to be a charming, little experience. It's fun, lighthearted, and colorful. And, it has the potential to be like all the fun bits of Mario Party without the extensively long play sessions and with RNG that doesn't feel nearly as unfair. Which is nice. Sadly...it has a few issues to get over before it can ever fill that slot. 

First of all, it needs way more game modes. It has a fair number of activities on its own. But, of the activities that I've played, about half of them made me groan in frustration every time they came up. Which wouldn't be that big of an issue except with the small pool of stuff to do, that means you'll be seeing them a LOT if you plan on playing this for any period of time. 
Second of all, it has a pretty significant cheater problem. Most matches I had in my hour and a half of gameplay, there was someone being dragged around with a mouse cursor all over the place on a plane above where everyone is waddling, walking on air after not making it across obstacles, or what have you. Now, their site claims that those people are having action taken against them, but it doesn't make for a great first impression.
Third of all, the player population seems to be really low. Now, admittedly, I do play at off hours due to my work schedule, so that will be a factor, but I was constantly timing out of matchmaking because it couldn't find enough people to form a match with. This game came out about a month ago. This should be a great cause for alarm for a game made to be a multiplayer only experience.
And finally, the biggest bug bear. It's a game that charges a fee to get in the door, but everything about it is designed around a free-to-play micropayments economy. All complete with its own special currency to make you not feel like you've spent actual money. Someone might try to argue that usual argument of ""it's just cosmetics"", but the cosmetics, especially in a multiplayer experience, do matter rather significantly. Plus, this game doesn't really have much else outside of that. And, if they didn't, the game wouldn't have put them in there to sell in the first place. Sure, you can earn stuff through gameplay, but progress is specifically designed to be glacial to bore you into forking over the cash. And, it's not as if the game even displays a big list of stuff that's available to buy. It shows you a handful of things at a time, all with an ominous countdown timer to try to convince you into ""buying before its gone"". Lads, if you wanted to make a F2P game, then just have it be a F2P game. Or, if you wanted to make a game you charge for up front, don't put a F2P micropayments-based economy into it.",False
"If you're planning on buying this because you saw your favorite youtuber/streamer play it and thought ""hey, this looks fun"", don't. Atleast, not now. There are too many cheaters in the game, never encountered so many cheaters back to back in game before.

Until they resolve the cheater problem, avoid this game.",False
"Oh my gosh. what a game, you will have so much fun while playing. But I found it a bit challenging, that might be because i just started playing it.

Anyway it is a game you should definitely try with couple of your friends.",True

"Reviewing this game in the SCAR format.

Skill - The game is primarily based on luck and funny moments that you had little control over. Mechanically speaking, the game only has a couple buttons which lowers the skill cap of the game by quite a bit. Each map having its own RNG allows for strategy, but that is about as complex as it will get. In coordinated play, there will always be room for niche strategies in a BR.

Community - The game has a very large community as it has been embraced through this pandemic as a beacon for groups of friends looking for something to play together. The game has little ways to actually communicate in-game which doesnt allow for people to make friends through the game, but also negates toxicity.

Accessibility - Many would say they never would have expected to see themselves paying $20 USD for a game where you play as a Jelly Bean and only have a few buttons to control your character in a Battle Royale format. But here we are. The pressure on friends to have something to play together has brought this game into accessible, but will not be able to reach its max potential without going free to play.

Reward - Putting hours upon hours into this game brings little reward. The biggest reward you will get as of 09/27/20 is being able show off to your friends that you can get #1 more than once. The eSports scene is a very odd prospect. With that, the game is very fun to WATCH as well as play. Streaming this game can lead to success as has been proven by content creators. So there is definitely potential on that front.

In Conclusion - This game has a lot of potential and is really in the hands of the developer to continue creating content for consumers to come back to. I enjoy it with my friends but find myself getting tired of it after a few days of playing. The game needs to go Free-to-play if it wants to become bigger than it already is. 6/10",True
"The first few rounds are lots of fun, especially with friends but be warned: The game is a cheater hell at the moment. Mostly speedhacks which is especially annoying if you are fighting for the crown in the last round. I recommend waiting a few months in.",False
"How it feels playing Fall Guys: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvq10Zp7AGo&list=PLbdZLniceBh_0UZim6j1MY4p9GtvtE4FO&index=5&t=12s

If I could thumbs neutral, I probably would at this point.

Charming, cutesy, easy to play / hard to win ""battle royale"" that felt more like Fuzion Frenzy.

At first it's manic fun for an hour, with a wide variety of stages / games, and winning is half luck as much as it is skill.  Definitely plug your controller in for this one.

But then, an hour later, the wide variety ISN'T anymore, and skill being involved about half the time means victory is purely random.

Server problems aside, which I believe were due to just not expecting so many players at launch, the game runs and looks great.  I have not played lately due to the aforementioned getting tired of it, so I cannot speak to what I see about the wave of cheaters.

Overall, good time for a short time.",True

From whimsy, fun animations, to immaculate audio design, Fall Guys captures the ridiculousness of shows like Wipe Out and puts it in your hands.

I cannot recommend this game enough. It is just plain fun. It captures the sort of nostalgia of watching old Nickelodean obstacle course shows and makes it readily available digitally.",True
"Imagine a game where you have to rage over having to balance a see-saw, well stop imagining because you have arrived to Fall Guys, ESports of the year.",True
the guys really falls i think it's good game,True
"As it stands right now, I wouldn't recommend the game.

I think it's not worthwhile considering I played it for 10 hours and I don't feel satisfied with the overall experience. There are still way too many flaws that perturbs the flow of the game in general. 

It's not that this game has no future, it's just that if it doesn't hurry to bring features, the current hype won't last long.

Which doesn't mean it's a complete failure : the style is appealing, the core concept is fun and the controls are basic yet efficient.


However, the minigames themselves are really what's splitting the community in multiple categories :

==> either utterly trash (Tip Toe, I'll explain why) or in need of a rework  :
 - Tip Toe : because it's safer to wait and not play if you aim for the win turning most of the players completely passive and cautious, since it's a late game mini-game, which is all the more infuriating if you lose now
 - Perfect Match : which is pointless when it comes to eleminate players since most people just follow the bigger packs
 - Door Dash : where the main issue lies in the fact that doors are too small compared to the amount of player at any point when it shows up
 - Royal Fumble : because of latency issues coupled to the rule itself, keeping the tail only gives you the win condition but it can be stolen at the very last second from 3 to 4 times the grab range.

==> considered unfair and/or annoying due to a clear issue with the notion of team-based minigame in a Battle Royale :
 - Fall Ball : forced to coordinate with people you have no control over coupled with weird wonky physic of the balls where force weirdly apply to them makes that one a ""tedious more than fun"" football game
 - Team Tail Tag : since a player can only carry a single tail at a time, and it's the number of tails at the end of the time that matters and not the time spent with one
 - Rock n' Roll : main issue being that teams can screw with other team's ball for way too long with no time limit, wasting everyone's time
 - Hoadrers : inferior to Egg Scramble on every level because of how tedious the ball physics behave with multiple players around them

NB : Hoopsie Daisy, Jinx and Egg Scramble are not as good as most ""free for all minigames"" but are way above the ones I mentionned before.

==> Are way too dependant on a scenario and/or luck factor to be enjoyable :
 - Fall Mountain : some players will start on the 2nd row, putting them behind and giving the whole 1st line of players an advantage
 - See Saw : ruins the flow for the players who are behind from the start because of plateforms stuck for way too long at a 80° angle.
- Fruit Chute : unlikely but the randomness of multiple fruits bouncing on each others can affect a group of players more than the one on the opposite side and the fact that you're on a conveyor belt doesn't allow you to dodge as efficiently as possible


The ones I didn't mention are the one I would consider fun or for at the very least ""more satisfying than frustrating"". Considering there are 25 mini-games currently, it means 11 mini-games aren't satisfying to replay.
That's almost half of the entire roster of mini-games that most people would prefer to avoid.


The game lacks these features that would help make the game way better :
- Map Creator with Dev Fonctionnalities
- Map Variations for the same mini-game
- Private Servers
- Waiting Preparation Area
- More Fall Guys customization
- Voting System (mini-game choice for instances)

It also lacks key features and quality of lifes features (may sound like nitpicking but that's just how I felt for a while) :
- Filters (so we can finally have names instead of 4 numbers)
- Being able to quit during a game without being stuck waiting to pause
- Being able to exit the game without going in the right tab
- Being able to play with more than 2 friends in a party


I'm probably missing some stuff there and there but I hope people will still get the overall idea.

PS : I may change the review depending on how Mediatonic handles the content of Fall Guys in the future.

Edit 07/09/20

The state of the game has worsen : always 2-3 cheaters in every game, still stuck with random generated rumbers for a name and the teaser for season 2 is just an eye candy made to hide the current flaws of the game.

There's no need for heroic-fantasy based maps and skins if it's going to feel as repetitive and boring as what we have right now.

I recommend the game even less than before. No real upgrade and the clocks is still ticking.",False
"Fall Guys is an interresting plateforming game but there are too many cheaters to fully enjoy the experience.

At first, i was literraly taking my time to send a report for every one i could see (that means goes to there website and fill a request thing, each time. There's no in-game report...) but now they ""asked"" us to NOT do so. Thought, cheaters are always here. Though, i've got to admit, i saw some getting kicked before the end but too many of them reach the finale and just speed hack to the crown, fly above hexagones, get in the middle of the twirly finale. 

This needs to be fixed NOW ! This became not enjoyable at all ! What's the point of playing if you know you have 0% of winning ? I really hope the devs will fix this problem fast at or before Season 2. Or else, players are going to leave the game... fast and there won't be a season 3. 

Make an in-game report system : maybe calling a bot if several reports about one player in particular to observe his moves/speed/height then decide of the right solution at the end of the round or next one (so it avoid people to report good players for winning fairly). 
Make the anti-cheat better : sadly, this is will be a forever task to do but it's NOT an option in a battle royale, especially when there is already a luck factor in some mini-games. Until they give up, it will be a constant fight.
Punish the cheaters : i don't know what you do to they currently but maybe give them a first warning with a temporary ban then more pushniments like be stuck in a multiplayer for cheaters only (so they can get a taste of their own medecine) or discard their crowns/items that they didn't earn fairly.

Sure, there are some launch server issues at the time of this review, but looking past that: This game has potential! It is fun in current state, if they can give us some more features such as:
Private servers/groups for more than 4 people
Twitch Integration
Crossplay

Already know they will introduce more maps, which will be needed to add on the longevity of the game

One negative (If I have to look) is their business model... You buy the game for 20 Euros, and then you can buy more skins and even more Kudos' ... I personally believe it is either free to play or you pay for the game.. Game skins and so on that is bought inside the game, belongs only in free to play games. Doing both at the time of this review is a tad overkill, but not enough in current state to make this a huge negative for me though",True
"Blatant and constant cheating.The game's fun when you get to play it competitively, but anecdotally: you run into people just straight up using FlyHacks and IronGrip hacks to eliminate people ever 3rd or 4th round. Considering how short they can be, that leads to running into completely unhidden hacks every 10-15 minutes.Honestly, it's a dope game, when you're allowed to play fair matches. I think that's what makes it so extra frustrating that a high percentage of them AREN'T fair games.Coupled with a REALLY lackluster developer response to cheating (even AFTER the implementation of Anti-Cheat), I recommend you wait until the game is either HEAVILY discounted or until they actually start doing something to prevent these cheats.Get it after this nonsense is handled, or when it's so cheap that even an hour of fun is worth the price tag.",False

"This game is alright, it's kinda like a gmod minigame brought to fruition. Nothing really special is done here, it's at the most a kids game. The content is extremely lacking, team games are won more thru who has better ping than anything else. More than 60 percent of the time launching the game I am met with server errors so I can't even get attached to the game or play it consistently. In reality it's like they took gangbeasts, and they made it less interactive and dumbed down, then charged more for it and sold it to the mass public. It's just one of those meh games, for a full release I'm relatively dissapointed, it's one of the hyped up streamer games rather than anything else. It should be free to play with all the microtransactions thrown in my face. If it was more play to gain friendly it would be a better game but a full release with like 14 maps and only a few variations in experience every time. Costing 20 dollars is just way too much.

I like it, I am playing it and will continue to play but I can't recommend it as it is now.

Literally 100% of games I had in last 2 days had cheaters in them. It is not an over-statement.

I played maybe 3 to 4 hours in last 2 days.

I spent 10 minutes today watch 2 cheaters being AFK floating on last level. I had to disconnect so I do not know which one won. Maybe they are still there.

That is insane. Seriously way worse than anything I ever saw in my life .. chinese/asian server of PUBG included.

"The game idea is really unique. It is a  battleroyale style game with minigames that reminds me of Wipeout and  Takeshi's Castle. also the artstyle looks cute and fun.I can imagine this game got a lot of hype because of it.  

Sadly when I played it myself  I found the minigames really shallow and repetitive. This game is nice to do a round of 2 for a day and thats it.  Maybe if you play with friends in your party it is more fun but the game's price tag is a little bit high for my friends to impulse buy.  Allso there are microtransactions in this game for cosmetic items. You earn enough ingame points to buy stuff and there is this seasonpass  which unlocks you more ingame credits and costumes. 

The ingame seasonpass actualy makes me feel the pressure to unlock everything and i am allready playing more then I like. It feels allready as a bad grind.

"I love party games but I just didnt really find this fun at all. The competition sucked a lot of the fun out of it for me, because when I play party games with friends, I want the end-reward to be that I won the game and had fun with people I know. This game gets rid of both those things by making the focus on getting crowns for cosmetic items and by making it very hard to play with friends, especially if you want to play with more than 3 other people.That means the only thing fun about this is the gameplay itself, which is intentionally simplistic and heavily relies on its physics, which I dont think is fun because of how often it feels frustrating, and as if your chances of winning aren't based on your skill but rather your luck and the mindless actions of other players. Yes, there is a decently high skill ceiling, but if I wanted to play a challenging but frustrating game to get better at it, I'd be playing one of the million shooters with better gameplay and better ways to play with friends.",False

Run, get hit, get grabbed, some asshole pushes you off the map, fall, exit game, find match, repeat. 

Honestly such a fun goofy game, need more games like it. Put almost 10 hours in two days for 20 bucks so definitely will get my moneys worth out of it.

"with a 11 hours of beta play time I gotta say this is one of the most fun Ive had in a BR game, Its a shame the servers had some issues on launch causing a review bomb, Have handed out beta keys to all my friends and grouped up so here is a small pro and con list ive compiled

pro:
easy to pick up and play anytime
most games are more fun with friends, This game is fun to me with or without friends, Its a fun time
game modes are fun and tricky at times, no one expects to get sniped by a giant fruit as you're about to win
games are fast and you can hop right back into another game win or lose
can earn crowns from playing and earn tons of cosmetic items with the free pass

cons:
map rotation could use some tweaks
seesaw could use some help as anyone not in front gets stuck  since you have to work with the others to get over and causes the game to drag on sometimes
people queued with if they get eliminated can't do much so could drag on for them sadly
streamers can be subject to grief

ideas
Game could use bigger lobbies for streamers and private mode
workshop would benefit greatly- new skins they could work into the game like csgo and maps for private lobbies

Thanks for the fun game, I am awaiting to see the future of the game and see how it moves from here

"This game has the potential to be a very fun and silly game, but unfortunately, it completely fails at doing so because the developers cant decide what kind of game it is. Is it a silly game for fun where you don't need to care if you win? Or a game where you actually need to try and win for better and cooler skins? They try to do both, but that isn't possible. They contradict each other. Most of the game modes are very luck based, where you don't really have much of a say whether or not you win. That wouldn't be much of a problem, if i didn't NEED to get wins in order to unlock certain skins. If that's the case, and i have very little control over if I win, then technically speaking I could never get these skins. That is pretty stupid and causes way too much frustration which makes it too hard to continue playing the game for after a couple games or so. The games are super unbalanced and there is no actual consistency between the modes. It feels like there almost wasn't any play testing, for instance some levels feel wayyyyy too crowded to the point where you almost have no control of your character because there are too many players on certain levels. Some levels feel like they shouldn't allow so many people, perfect example is tnt run. The gamemode is able to house up to 15 people, which is wayyyy too many people for a mode like tnt run. There are countless examples of this throughout the game, another good example is the slime rising level. This level is actually one of the more fun levels in the game, and can be a lot of fun with friends. However, sometimes there are wayy too many people on the level sometimes and it causes the level to almost feel unplayable, as you literally cant climb the mountain and focus on the actual obstacles your supposed to be dodging, because your too busy trying to get out of the way of other players. I could go on and on about how luck based and random the games feel, but it can be summed up by saying that the game should try to figure out what it wants to be and stick to it. If the game wants me to get wins in order to get stuff, then maybe adjust the levels to be more skilled based and less luck based. Also, the player sizes on some levels definitely should be looked at and adjusted. This game has the potential to be a super fun game that you can sit with your friends and play for hours on end having a blast, but instead it lasts for around twenty to thirty minutes, contains tons of keyboard smashing and then switches to another game because its just too much to bear at that point.",False

"[h1] Fall Guys Review [/h1]

Let me start off by saying [i] Fall Guys[/i] is [b] far [/b] from a poor game. I believe this game has incredible untapped potential, but lacks in polish where it is a necessity. In its current state, I do not recommend this game. Thanks to its myriad of issues, which I will cover here.

[h1] Good Things. [/h1]
I'll start off with Fall Guys' strong points.

[list]
[*] Rounds are brief, keeping games fast.
[*] Playing with friends allows for a more enjoyable experience, even if dying first, spectating is reasonably enjoyable.
[*] Good looking maps[/list]

[h1] Things To Be Improved On [/h1]

[b] Physics [/b] 
Utilising Unity's default physics engine, the game showcases an appallingly inconsistent experience with gravity. On numerous occasions, my character has seemingly tripped over its feet. Nine times out of ten, I will make that jump. The other 10%, I won't. On that subject, I would also like to mention the speed at which characters regain their balance. Again, Nine times out of ten, I will stand up reasonably swiftly. The other 10%, it will take much longer. Sometimes when I bump into someone else, I'll be fine. Sometimes it will send me across the map. Seeing a trend? Inconsistency is very prevalent for its physics, coming from a physics-based game.

[b] Repetitiveness [/b]
This game is abhorrent with variety. Most games comprise running from A to B, or are team modes which I will get into soon. It is difficult to continue playing a game when you seeer  the same game modes time and time again. I feel that more could have been done to keep the game fresh.

[b] Team Modes [/b]
Team modes should not be in a game like this. At least, not executed like this. Team modes are both belittling and frustrating because you have an infinitesimal amount of control over the game. It feels sometimes as if the team modes are more luck based than skilled. As well as that, the team mode ""Tail Tag"" is notable as it is a direct simulacrum of the non-team version of ""Tail Tag.""

[b] The Servers [/b]

In short, they are very bad. Daily, I experienced disconnections several times. You won't get in a game, but your friends will. The entire game of sixty people disconnected in a matter of seconds into the first round. Even after this game has been out for months, it still struggles to support the influx of recent players.

[b] Usernames [/b]
Names. Steam names were removed from the game early on for an easily fixed reason: HTML codes. Using these codes would make players’ names appear in colour, bigger in a different font, etc. Instead of fixing this issue, they remove the username system. Further, this issue has more effects when you see a hacker. It is impossible to report a cheater, as their names are always ""Fall Guy ****"" In many of my games I found cheaters and with no way of reporting them, this decision further degrades its integrity.

[b] Verdict [/b]
Fall Guys has incredible potential, but it lacks the simple requirement needed for a replayable, enjoyable game. Unfortunately, until Mediatonic resolve these issues, I do not recommend this game.

"Incredibly entertaining ninja warrior-style gameplay. It's fun with friends and playing by yourself. The matches and load times are fast enough to where it doesn't feel so punishing to lose on the first qualifier. Tons of customization options and goofy skins. The game oozes charm.

If I had to give it a con, it would be the team based rounds but that's because relying on potatoes is sometimes not so fun.",True
"I only have two hours of play in this game and in that time, joining any match I had a hacker in it. The anti cheat in this game is terrible to non-existent and the controls are so so. It's honestly just MXC or wipeout with jellybeans. I requested my money back since this game is practically unplayable when every match has a dude floating around or super sprinting to the finish, but the developer (despite having a successful launch) has opted out of refunding my payment. Enjoy the money you took from me, maybe put it into better anti cheat clients next time. What a terrible experience all around. I will not be doing business with this developer in the future.",False
"Too many hackers, it will ruin the fun for you, don't buy until they have an anti-cheat.",False
"I was a bit torn as to whether or not I should recommend this game or not, and ultimately I landed on No for a few reasons.

1. Inconsistency - Much of the physics in this game feel incredibly inconsistent. For instance, in Fall Ball I can be running at full speed towards the ball and do a jumping dive attack and the ball does not move hardly at all, but then someone else can walk up to it and lightly tap it and send the ball flying. Whether or not there is some trick to it I have not been able to find (and I don't think there is one, evidence of this to come in a moment), but this inconsistency isn't ""fun chaos"" it's incredibly frustrating when you're trying frantically to take advantage of the enemy being distracted and forgetting about a ball entirely only to be able to move it 3 inches and then have the opposing team member come by 15 seconds later and lightly pop it into the air and have it fly straight into my goal on the other side of the field! Similarly the grabbing mechanic seems to be totally random in its effectiveness. I play with this mechanic a lot in the memory match game and I've found that it seems to be totally random in whether or not me grabbing and pulling/pushing someone who is just standing still has any effect. I can be running at them full speed or just standing next to them and grab them and it seems to have equally random results. This also seems to be true of running bops where you just run into the other people. On several occasions I have been sitting still on a panel in memory match and then another player runs in and bops me right off the edge from near the middle, but when I try to do the same to try and figure out the mechanics and stir some mischief, I end up sliding right off the other guy rather than bopping him with my big jelly bean body.

2. Hackers Abound - In a battle royale game where there can be only one winner, hackers completely ruin the experience and my drive to continue playing. The devs keep saying that they're doing something about it, but almost every single match I play still has hackers in them. However, as I mentioned before, it's these hackers that further help prove my point that fall ball momentum and physics are total BS. I've had several matches now where the hacker takes flight and starts bashing into the balls at top velocity and even they are not always able to send the ball flying. In fact it seems like the faster they go the LESS speed a ball gets imparted with, which could suggest that the balls might not react to swift motion as much as slow and gradual motion, which is so damn counter intuitive in a game where a slight breeze is enough to knock my jelly bean on his butt for 30 seconds! Anyways, the hackers completely ruin the game for me and have caused me to stop playing several nights because I've just had enough. I'm honestly just about ready to swear off the game as a result until they get it fixed.

3. Too much troll enabling - There are a couple of games that make it far too easy for a lone troll to block NEARLY EVERY player from reaching the goal SINGLE HANDEDLY. I get that trolling is part of the fun and all, but giving a troll such godlike powers in already tough(ish) games like Slime Climb is infuriating, not entertaining. If you're going to allow and even encourage trolling of this level, then you need effective counter troll methods to deal with it. I've attempted suicide grab leaps to try and take down the troll only to have them lightly grab and release me and I drop off the side of the padded cylinder like all the rest. I should be able to at least knock him off with me if I take a full flying leap at him and land the hit, not just be brushed off because the grab mechanic stops my momentum momentarily like that. It's too much power in the hands of these trolls and while I'm sure they're having a good old time, it makes the rest of the players behind them have a bad time.

4. Crown Stinginess - If you want to focus on chaos, then don't have items locked behind winning crowns. It's very frustrating to lose final match after final match because of what basically amounts to luck. 7/10 times I step off the platform to climb the mountain and I'm fine, but those other 3 times my Jelly bean seems to twist his ankle and fall to the ground while all the others leap over my prone body. Again very frustrating inconsistency of motion and it basically puts me so far behind through no fault of my own that I might as well give up right there. At least the jumping finales like hexagone and jump club seem to be more or less fair (assuming you don't clip through the floor *cough* hexagone *cough*). Anyways, because the games are not largely skill based, keeping special items locked away behind crowns doesn't really make you get the feeling of accomplishment that I do with other MMO battle arena games. I've won a total of 3 matches so far and I'm level 27 as of writing this, but I've almost come in first a couple dozen times, so it seems a bit unfair that I only have 5 crowns so far to spend which can get me exactly one piece of legendary gear. This isn't a grind, it's a freakin' lotto for getting crowns on whether or not you'll get a hacker or have games that seem to pick winners rather than determine them. If you want people to ignore the prizes for the most part and just have fun playing, then give crowns to the top 5 or something, at least then people will feel like they actually have a chance to grind out some of the sweet gear. At this rate it will be another month before I can get a full set of legendaries and then we'll be on to season 2 so the set I want might not even be available anymore depending on how they update the shop.

5. Impossible Achievements - Going off of the last point. There's an achievement that is almost entirely impossible. It's the win 5 games in a row achievement and you would need incredible luck (or to hack the game) in order to get that achievement. I admit I'm an achievement whore, and this is just a fun game to pass the time, but come on man. That' s flipping ridiculous for the current game model.

6. Connection issues - This is a purely online multiplayer experience so connection issues and being booted from games are pretty inexcusable. I have a really good fiber internet connection and can play most any other online game without even a hint of a problem, but I get disconnected from Fall Guys at least 3 times a day. I even lost a crown that I was almost assuredly going to win because I was 3-4 layers up with plenty of tiles in hexagone and the last two guys were on the bottom platform when I get a sudden notification that I was disconnected. I damn near broke my controller and I never get the drive to take out my frustrations on inanimate objects like that...

All that being said, the reason I still play it is because I do like the game. It's fun and quirky when things are ""working"" properly, but man is it rough when they aren't. I see so much potential for this game, but they need to get these things under control or I may end up putting it down for a long long time for my own sanity's sake. As such, I really cannot recommend this game in good conscience at this time.

Also, don't buy if you are from SEA/Oceania if you can only play in the morning as servers are usually down. This has been an issue since long time ago as far as I know based on discord and reddit.

In addition to this at least half of the games are a complete waste of everyone's time such as any team based game, tail tag (and its three versions), and perfect match. Tail tag is a game where you can afk for 1:30 minutes and play for the last 30 seconds, team games are luck based as you either get a good team or a bad one (such as people being afk, rage quitting, or just bad at the game), and perfect match is straight up 2 minutes of your time wasted as EVERYONE can pass this game without being eliminated.

"Wanted to update my review now that the dev's appear to have actually solved the issues with the servers.

As it stands Fall guys presents itself as a skill based series of mini games.

The problem is the game is programmed to be unreliable.

The physics are questionable at best, sometimes you barely react to a hit sometimes you go flying.

Your character is horribly unstable, you seem to trip and fall from the slightest push, the slightest uneven landing, the slightest fall that's even remotely longer than your jump height. I've had my guy fall over for literally no reason. I jumped, didn't fall any special distance, and he just did half a back flip and landed on his face and rolled right off the stage. No reason, no one near me, nothing uneven to land on, no idea why.

You can even fall just from people walking into you or jumping on you.

When you fall it's a total crap shoot on how fast you'll get up. Sometimes your on your feet immediately sometimes the guy just flails about for 5-10 seconds. Totally random.

The worst thing about this game is the collision with other players. The courses themselves are not hard, but the fact that 50-60 people are trying to squeeze through the same little areas and everyone can knock each other down means you are either the first few guys through it, or you're gonna be stuck there awhile.

Then there's the lag issues. Because latentcy is a problem here, you'll often find in the team games that you get grabbed, tagged, ect, from people who are nowhere near you and when you try to do the same back, you can't seem to reach them even if you're literally on top of them. Occasionally it's extra buggy and you grab them, the animation plays, they get pulled back, but you don't get the tag counted. They still have a tail or some such thing you were trying to take and you are holding them?

The other issue is the team games. you aren't trying to win, you're just trying not to lose. Well most of the team games are 3 way battles. So when one team gets down in points the other two teams almost always gang up on the weaker team and bully them out. Nothing you can do when 10v10v10 turns into 20v10. Half the team games also have this thing where near the end of a round they toss out an item worth a stupid amount of points. So even if you've been leading the entire game, if the other team scores once with that item it's suddenly a tie or even your loss even though you were dominating them most of the match.

All in all, most of the time, when you lose it's not because of anything you really did so much as it is the horribly unreliable controls and over all chaotic games. If you start in the back you are in for a bad time.

Even if you do enjoy this kind of thing, the map variety is VERY low and the game gets old very quickly. All in all it's really not worth $20.",False

[h1] [b]6/10 [/b][/h1]

An elimination game mode which consist in a series of different phases and levels, mixed with Free for all and Team based modes. 

The first phase usually have 60 players, if you manage to survive being in the top 40+ going from point A to point B you'll be qualified to go to the next phase which consist around the half of players from the first phase. 

Next phase it is a randomly selected map, which may consist in a Free for all mode as the first phase or splitted between Teams, and each phase continues until there is a winner.

Considering FFA and Teams modes are mixed between the phases, expect a lot of trolling or being disqualified for the next phase. 
Just have fun despite dealing with the unbalanced mechanics. 

Cons:

-For what it offers and price, I was expecting more content.

-Team game modes are not that well balanced, expect a lot of trolling

-Speed cheats are present in some games, the anti cheat measures in-game are weak.

-High latency players. Expect getting grabbed from a distance due to players with a high ping. Not sure if is a bad latency or a server with packet loss issues, it is annoying.

"Takeshi's Castle is a Japanese game show.

Each show finished with a ""Final Showdown"" in which Count Takeshi (Kitano) was faced by the remaining contestants. In early episodes they would storm the castle set itself in a short-range water gun assault. Later episodes introduced carts with paper rings, and eventually lasers and light-sensitive targets.

The game becomes boring too quickly. Random level order doesn't help much and team levels are just horrible (except tails).,False
"This game has tons of potential. There are major issues I am not seeing mentioned in reviews. 
1. The game has blatant and obvious hackers who remain in games even after using what look like developer tools (ex. moving at 100 times normal speed, flying/hovering, being untouchable/immune etc) 
2. The mechanics of grabbing (a requirement of roughly 1/3 of the mini-games) seem much too latency dependent. You can often be grabbed from great distances away, or grabs that look solid on your screen don't register (ex. snatching tails) 
3. The game will create deliberately unbalance teams. For example, with 14 players remaining, the game will pick a 3 team game, necessitating a 5v5v4. It seems to have no mechanic built in to avoid this problem. It could simply select a 2 or 4 team game when the number of remaining players is even and a 3 team game when divisible by 3. If the remaining number of players is prime, simply don't select a team game. This wouldn't be a big issue with 11v11v12 or something similar, but the game will give 4v5 soccer matches, or 5v5v6 stone pushing contests.  
As I stated before, the game has lots of potential, but there are some glaring issues that need addressing. They often ruin what should otherwise be a really excellent concept and much needed fun and social game.",False
"While I would love to give this game a good review, in it's current state I just can't and this is because of a large amount of reasons, none of them small. 

For starters, let's get some of the pros of this come out of the way. For one, this game has some greatly satisfying and repeatable gameplay to it. I'm not sure what it is, but the overall gameplay just doesn't get boring even if you don't win. Then theres the monetization, while i'm not one to keen on the whole idea of monetization in payed games, this game does it the right way to where it isn't egregious in the slightest. All outfits can be earned with currency, and the best outfits are bought ""crowns"" this is a currency earned by purely winning a game. Hell, even the ""battlepass"" which is something I despise is completely free.

Now, while this game has some strong aspects going for it, it is not in a state I can recommend by any means. The biggest issue by far as of right now is the ridiculous amount of cheaters. It's gotten so bad to the point where you can't go 2 rounds without encountering someone zipping about in the air or speed hacking. Even the response given to this is awful, the team encourages people to not report cheaters and instead refrain from sharing videos of them to discourage more cheating. This is single handedly the worst response to a cheating issue i think i've seen to date. This reason in it of itself is enough for me to dislike the game, but i prefer to list all the cons and pros of a game to get the full picture.

Now, the bugs in this game are very annoying. For starters, player physics are completely tied to FPS. What does this mean? Well, this means that if your FPS is to low you'll fall on your butt like a disabled kid without his crutches. On the other end of the spectrum, to high FPS and you'll be slip and sliding around like you're running on a tarp after a lesbian orgy was had on it. 60fps is the default cap, and the only way to disable this is by turning VSYNC off which actually turns it on or by using nvidia control panel. Though, unless you enjoy falling flat on your face all the time this is highly discouraged. And then we have the near CONSTANT soft locks of this game, you'll be hard pressed to not find yourself needing to task manager close the game with the amount of times you'll be soft locked. On the bright side, this soft lock only happens when you are already dead, but what this lock is, is when you are unable to open the esc menu in order to leave the game.

In all honesty though, my biggest issue is the sheer lack of content. Theres 25 minigames, which sounds like a decent number right? Except the way the game is structured, you'll see the same ones over and over again, and they only show up on certain rounds leading up to the small 4 finals. By the time that season 2 drops at the time of writing this, we will be 2 months without a single new minigame which is just unacceptable. 

All in all, this game has a huge amount of potential but I don't see it surviving past november with how the devs are handling this game. There are many issues, and none of them small. Once season 2 drops, I'll come back to this review and update it on how the game is then but I still don't have high hopes.

I love the idea of a platforming battle royale, and the art style of this game is incredibly fun and appealing. And it stings me that over my two hours before refunding it that I grew to hate it so much

The controls are just an inch over the line of being unresponsive and irritating that you will grow to hate it, and you fall over more than you'd like
It's funny when you get knocked away super hard or fail to make a jump in a comedic way, those moments are fun. But so much more often than not, you will feel like your loss was hardly your own fault, and it gets frustrating

There are connection issues which add to the frustration, but they are far from the worst part. Overall, I think the physics need more work, I think the controls need to be a little tighter
But above all there needs to be FAR more map variety, more of the Racing type preferably; being the best mode in the game

I ordered my refund, as it is, Fall Guys has left me significantly disappointed after being excited for it for so long",False
very good,True
good game but the servers are potato and 8 out of 10 games you play will be infested with hackers,False
"It's fun, especially with friends. It's welcome wears thin after about an hour of gameplay at a time.",True
"A fun simple Battle Royal with with a very strong ""Just one more"" going on.",True
"Pros and cons are down below) Check out gameplay here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3HvFtAiXA&feature=youtu.be

Advantages:
1. The game is fun! It's very simple, a bit goofy and hilarious (at least until you start raging at minor annoyances). The races or team games are very interesting, and I suspect that devs occasionally add more (as recently I played some I've never seen before, though maybe I was just unlucky enough).
2. The game poses a challenge. It's not easy to win. And that makes it even more fun!
3. I also like how cute these beans are! There are so many cosmetics to make your bean the cutest one. I just adore that, even though I am not such a big fan of cosmetics.

Disadvantages:
1. The game is still broken. It had issues with servers inability to sustain so many players at once. Now the game still has similar issues. Sometimes it kicks you out of the episode for no reason, sometimes you ""lose connection"", though you have 5G, so this was obviously not your problem. Sometimes the whole episode breaks and you don't even get rewards for it.
2. Temporarily (at least, I hope it's temporarily) developers disabled your nicknames in the game. So, every player is ""FallGuy№"", which is no fun at all. Makes it impossible to find your friends among all the players.
3. Though, the game is fun, it's also stressful as heck. I guess this might be a problem for overachievers or perfectionists.
4. Some of the achievements (if you are concerned about them) are literally impossible to get. There are some that no player has. Some like ""win 5 episodes in a row"". R u nuts? Achievements must be fun, sometimes a bit challenging, but that is over the top even for me.

Overall:
I like Fall Guys a lot! There are lots of inconveniences but overall, the game is still worth playing. When you start winning episodes, it feels so great, you want to play more and more and more and more....

Hope my feedback was useful both to players and to developers!",True
"Servers are more offline than online, I will update my review once the server are back online and the game gets really repetitive, really fast

Utterly ruined by hackers, with the devs pretending it isn't an issue.",False

Best Arcade game in this month,True
"Great game for casual fun. Finally, I can live my dream of participating in Takeshi's Castle.

If you are looking for a competitive, skill-based game, you are going to have a hard time here. There are lots of factors that you cannot control and are random.

Disregard the bad reviews because of the server performance. It is one day after launch and they already upped their game.",True
"(Note: I put 14 hours into the closed beta in addition to the time above, which is why I feel comfortable writing a review).

It's rare that I try a game on a whim and immediately fall in love with it, but that's exactly what happened with Fall Guys. It's a fun twist on the battle royale genre that swaps shooting with a collection of minigames that feel ripped right out of Mario Party. The aesthetic is very goofy and charming, and you will definitely laugh the first time you see fifty players fall into the same pit at the same time. 

I do have some complaints - a few of the games just aren't as good as the rest. Fall Ball is just a very bad and clunky Rocket League. The memory game is too easy and often leads to not enough players getting eliminated. Fall Mountain would work as an earlier round but there's just too much randomness for it to be a fun finale.

I've seen people complain that it might get too repetitive too quickly, but its worth noting that the devs have said they're going to continue to support the game with new minigames and new modes. I also think anyone who thinks this isn't worth $20 is out of their minds - I've had more fun with Fall Guys than any AAA games I've played this year. I'm sure I'll put at least another dozen hours into it within a week or two.

Get it, you won't regret it.

PS: If you're having server issues, don't reviewbomb, just chill - this game is made by an indie team that doesn't have EA/Activision's resources and they certainly didn't expect ~100k players in a day. They're doing their best.",True
"fun game :)
",True
"Fall Guys is a colorful and cute looking, Battle Royal game where you race against 59 other players to become the jellybean of the hill and earn the crown.

Each game is divided into mostly 5 rounds, and in each round you'll play 1 of the 25 mini games.
When you are too slow, make too many mistakes or fail as a team, you'll get eliminated, this is an ongoing process until there is only 1 jellybean standing.
The levels look adorable and remind me of children's bouncy castles, this is something that made me want to get the game in the first place.

Your character is a jellybean, and you can customize him to your own liking by buying outfits, patterns and colors in the shop with kudos or crowns.
Kudos can be gained by playing games or bought with micro-transactions for real money.
Crowns can only be earned by winning games and you can unlock 3 crowns in the free seasonal battle pass.
Every 2 days a new legendary outfit becomes available in the shop and this outfit costs 10 crowns.
In the time I played the Beta and the full release I haven't won even once, do you see where this is going? Yea... A game filled with cheaters.

The game doesn't have an anti cheat for some reason, you can't report a player in-game, you need to make a video and post it on their Discord.
Only 1 person wins a crown each game so if you have a cheater in your game there is no way of winning.
All epic and legendary items in the shop cost between 1 and 5 crowns, which is expensive and for many of us nearly impossible.
The game is constantly down due to server issues, bugs, glitches, exploits and it's starting to get frustrating!

Playing with friends isn't really fun, you only play together when there is a team-play mini-game.
If you get eliminated you can spectate your friend, but it doesn't go straight to your friend, instead you need to click through everybody that is still alive.
There is no split-screen to see all your friends that are still alive, you just have to click back and forth between every player.

Another thing I extremely disliked is the fact that they made the game free on release for a month on PlayStation Plus.
And even though I bought it, the game got released with a 4,99€ costing cosmetic DLC.
People on Discord are only allowed to say positive things and saying WTF is already crossing the line.
By the looks of it, streamers are getting paid to play and promote this game.

Overall, the game has potential but at this point it starts to feel repetitive and frustrating, because the chance of winning is so low.",False

"The game can be fun on small dosage, but to be honest, it's more frustrating than anything. The clumsy physics is in place to try and hide the problem that this game has such a huge amount of desync between players that it'll be the number 1 reason why you fail most of the trials. It can be fun with friends in a voice chat, and I'll probably play it with friends again, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend Fall Guys in its current state.

"TLDR:
If you don't mind servers and basic game features failing non stop, I recommend you this game. It's unique and fun if it works well and with friends it's even better.
If basic gameplay failures can easily makes you angry: do not play this one at all.
Mostly I do not recommend it to the general in the current state... failing netcode, failing server, failing physics, kinda failing gameplay with a fun, addictive, cartoony look.

(Might change it in the future if issues are fixed)


Long:
A friendly, cartoony looking fun game that contains a lot of fun and great game ideas combining battle royale genre with and agility. Imagine this game like Wipeout or Takeshi's Castle  You are controlling a jelly bean and racing against other 59 beans to become the ... crowned???
This game gameplay wise is a well thought out game and got plenty of fun element to be enjoyable. It got ~24 unique(ish) mini-game that definitely give you a few hours of fun. If you got friends it will most certainly multiply the fun factor (4 player per squad). This game features plenty of customisations including clothing, emotes, winning cinematic, patterns and more... This also introduces 2 different currencies, one is kudos and the other is crown, they both can be achieved by playing the game, but the crown can only be achieved if you win the game (which can be painful for the reasons that will be listed soon) or on the free season pass. On paper this game sounds like a winner because it could be, but the bad things were not discussed yet.

The bad:

The first and most common are the server issues... You probably saw news about it so I'll shorten it: They said they was not expecting that much player when it was well known it will be a PlayStation plus title from the release date... for 36 millions...AND NOT EXPECTING IT?!?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!.
Another one: Despite the fact they claimed they sorted out the server issues... the issues are still there, but not as common anymore... but something is still problematic.

Netcode (or still server): The game were working supremely fine on the first few day if you ignored the server issues, but this is becoming more and more of an issue as more and more clips are popping up regarding the issues that are introduced in the last ~8 days as there are more and more issues with unexpected behaviour and delays between player actions.  A simple example here: In the final tail grab mode I've grabbed my opponent's tail who was on the ground and I'm already 15 meter away from him and also on a different level and he just stands up, grabs the air and I just lose the tail there and with that I lose the game because his arms are somehow capable of reaching me 15+ meter away while I was already running away from him for 3-4!! seconds. 
Another exaple: Collecting eggs and I picked up the golden egg, Carrying it for 5 seconds towards my base and suddenly the egg just phased out from my arms into my opponent's arm. Seeing your opponents just casually running in the air in hex-a-gone is also a phenomenal feeling.
Bonus fact: For some game were interacting with an object is heavily tied to your ping, you do not have any options to see your ping ingame which is a fail too.

Physics: This is where the multi-layered “fun” starts. 
First issue: Depending on the refresh rate of your monitor it can heavily affect how physics elements interact with you, it can modify a player's speed too (for some reason...).
Second issue: Some enemy players got godlike strength and just push you away by just running into you and they can easily push you away for 40 meters, if you attempt to do that your opponents will just act like a brick, this can fall under the netcode part for sure, but there are some proofs that clarify that it is just a failure on the physics part. (the easiest to prove: just stand in the spawn and let someone with godlike power run into you and they will push you away even though there are no possibility for the netcode to fail on your part because you did not even move...).
Third issue: On map like hexagon you can easily fall through layers despite there isn't a hole because the physics bugged out, and it's a bit common too, this also applies to other map like roll out where if you jump into the wall when it's on the side, you can fall through it, or just launches you towards the hole and you die which makes no sense at all.

Gameplay decisions:
The way each game is structured sometimes allows you to have a final with many players which can be fine sometimes depending on the map … but who the fuck thought that playing 20 player hex-a-gone is a good idea?!?! (Also when 20 players are playing the physics can fail more).
For the first added minigame they introduced an already existing game with minor changes and made it not so fun to play it because you are pushed into a really small place to carry out your action(s) in a(n extremely) slowly speeding up environment.

Settings: If you want your fps to match your refresh rate turn on v-sync, if you have it off you'll get fixed 60 fps... who the fucking hell does that seriously?
For some reason in this game I can't use GeForce experience so I can't record the issues.
Devs/marketing/whatever not answering a single query on any channel as I was asking them about the netcode issues.

To be honest I don't think this game deserves the score it have at the moment, I would give it a 4 or 5 out of 10 at the moment with the issues, if the majority of the problems would not exist I would give them an easy 9/10, but it's just a clumsy work honestly... it feels like someone decided to make this game prototype without having any experience in unity, decided to put some assets together and not even bothering to improve the game at all and release it.

Update: It turns out it was really made in unity, hitting the nail in the head. (I do not have any issue with unity, it was just obvious that no improvements were made.)",False
"definitely not worth 22 dollars, id love a refund but cant get one.",False
"a charming low-investment jungle gym sim with a bright, shiny aesthetic and heaps of built-in hype ... that i'd really love to play more but the steam release broke the servers already ಥ_ಥ

update: since the servers are mostly ironed out and i've spent about 10 hours falling and failing and wrecking i'll just say a few more things. 

1, more levels are needed to dump a considerable amount of hours into this game without it feeling like a grind toward the free battlepass cosmetics, which the devs have said they're working on now. the sooner the better.

2, the obvious bugs following a rocky launch DO challenge the net enjoyment of the game so just be wary of those before purchasing and keep your expectations in check; this does feel like an early access game to me and not a full launch, but there's a lot of transparency from the devs that makes me confident this decent game will eventually become a really great one.

3, the chaotic nature of each match is its saving grace and the single most frustrating element -- if you know each level well, there's still a very high chance you'll get smacked around by an RNG dependent flying fruit or toppled by an enemy jellybean, rendering you helplessly flailing on the ground for a couple seconds in defeat. however, this also means people who've played the beta and memorized the choreography of a stage perfectly might have the same thing happen and get destroyed by pure chance, letting you slip into the lead. since the game does feel quite low-stakes, losing miserably after doing so well doesn't feel that awful. you just re-enter the quick queue and begin again. still, luck plays a massive role in whether you qualify, take the crown, or fall trying.

and finally, 4, for my fellow cosmetics trash: you don't have to pay for ~anything~ with some effort and patience. you earn ingame currency (kudos) just by playing and doing well. the better you do, the more kudos + battlepass progression you gain. there's a decent amount of variety and the shop refreshes every 24 hours, so save up your kudos until you see something you genuinely want. color swatches, patterns, costumes, emotes, and victory dances are available and adorable and collecting them all feels satisfying in and of itself.

from one jellybean to another, buy it.",True
So I pre-orded the game with a huge throwback to Takeshi Castle.  Then the Beta came out and I had to play it so I did and it was a lot of fun with a mate from me. So when it came out on Steam i was awake at the excact time it was releast so i coud enjoy every minute of the early game phase and it was worth it. If you like a parcour battle royale game this is 100% one of the big games that will be out here. the only point what isnt enjoyable is that you get blocked way to much on the game but yeah that is player based! i would give this game a 9/10. oh yeah you also have a lot of costumes to dress up in and there is even more coming!,True
"The game's title did not lie

"This game is a disappointment.
Many mini-games are just really poorly designed, resulting in un-fun frustrating dice rolls of a game. The mountain with a crown at the top for example, is very easy so whoever spawns at the front wins. Most of the team-based games are unbearably wishy washy, it never feels like you're contributing to your teams success no matter what you do. The controls are intentionally unreliable, presumably to make you feel like the game is inconsistent on purpose (when in reality it's just the game struggling to synchronize so many players' physics). One minute you can jump and turn on a dime, the next minute you're falling over without even touching anyone or anything. It's akin to tripping in Brawl. And it's infuriating.

Most of the games need a rework. Level designs don't result in interesting or fun moments. The physics are frustratingly inconsistent. Some of the games need to be completely scrapped, like the random chance fake door one, or the incredibly easy memory game that you only fail if there are too many people in the match to fit on the tiles.  And frankly, because the game launched in this state, not to mention the absolute trainwreck the servers STILL are. I really don't see them fixing this game. They're going to ride the Twitch streamer  content/hype until this game is dead, and that will likely result in hefty sales and decent micro-transactions for them. So why would they bother putting effort in.

Other small things. You can't spectate your friends easily once you're down. You need to know their FallGuys ID number (or appearance but many people have similar costumes), and cycle through everyone until you find your friend. You also can't leave a match until it loads in and begins the next game, so you just end up waiting for a minute or so when you lose. And (atleast for now) there are many many players who specifically play to sabotage other people, not to win. So if you happen to get targeted by a troll, your game is over. And when you complete an event, it doesn't tell you what place you came in. While place doesn't actually affect anything (as far as I know) it would be a nice little metagame with yourself to try and place well in the games you qualify in. 


I'm all for party games, I love Mario Party games, and I get the appeal of a fun and light game like this. But this mostly feels like complete chance, that just requires un-fun effort on your part. I find games of chance fun, but this is just painful.

"This game has potential. Its fun with friends. Alone it a frustrating mess of half okay obstacle courses, and another half of terrible team based games with no cooperation. What the game excels at is a neat take on the battle royal genre, but fails at a actual way of task and reward. In other battle royals, you have a progression system for all. This makes it to where anyone can progress and still earn skins. Fall guys has this. What fall guys doesn't do is help support the oh so neat skins (that they are obsessed with talking about btw) for all players. In other battle royals, these are promotional and available to purchase. This allows those who dont want it to not have to, but those who do can spend the money and support the franchise. Fall Guys only allows you to claim skins with winnings. Not even there Kudos currency, only those who succeed (at least 10 games worth with both pants and chest costing 5) can purchase skins that are representation of other games, food franchises, super markets, or whatever other pointless shit they want to slap on a bean with legs. In a battle royal, that is ONE winner and 59 losers. with skins only lasting like three days. They must be expecting a player base of '𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀' who have the time to sit and throw fucking eggs in a hole. Oh, and did i mention playing the same 4 games over and over again? The game is so frustrating.",False

"Very repetitive at times, needs more minigames. Team matches can (and most of the time will) be frustrating. In most games, your starting position matters more than skill. 
Constant disconnects (this maybe solved in future updates or when the servers are under less load). Also this game desperately needs some option to change the voice of your avatar, hearing the same sample hundreds of times per game really gets old fast.

Edit: Several weeks after release the game is still suffering from a poor netcode (just play one round of catch and you'll know what I mean), the names are still ""FallGuy XYZ"" (rather than your Steam name), hackers in every second game. It almost seems like the new meta isn't to win, but rather to hinder the cheaters. 
The game still suffers from several small annoying things, for example: If you play in a party, the only indication of your mates are the small arrows above them. Once you're eliminated, those arrows are gone and you have to find them by their looks/""name"" (FallGuy1234). If you've managed to find them in time and they qualify for the next round, prepare to do the same thing again because the game doesnt remember which player you've spectated last.

Unless I just have bad rng I've seen every single stage multiple times, and to that end since the controls are very basic the amount of variety between the stages is poor regardless.  Maybe some sort of algorithm that picks stages on what's been played the least could help. Some maps are team based, and if you get and uneven amount of players one team is handicapped for no reason. There's a few levels that are so easy it's rare to see anyone get knocked out, which also kills any tension and player agency built. 

Collision detection is a little sketchy. The time it takes to get up after falling is random, even when it looks like it shouldn't. Grabbing other players is inconsistent. You can grab onto ledges to help yourself up but only when devs allow it, so no near falls off a ledge or sneaky tactics that could have made the game more interesting. I'd really like to see the ability to crazier stuff, but I do understand this is supposed to be a very accessible game, I think it just hurts the longevity of it.

Matching up with other players almost has no point. A group queue feature where you win or lose together would be a really awesome addition. I think we have enough players to support it.",False

"Updating my review after today's update.  Finally the developers have added the much needed anti-cheat system, which (so far) seems to be working fine.

There are around 25 minigames, the majority of which strike a good balance between luck and skill and are good fun.  The game is at it's best when you take it lightly and party up with a few friends to have a laugh.  

Events beyond your control, or a bad team in a team round, can lead to a loss though.  So if you are very competitive and easily frustrated, this might not be the best game for you.   Losing may not always seem fair (although it usually is).  

Some minigames quickly get boring/repetitive (perfect match, rollout, block party), are somewhat broken due to lag (all the games involving tails), or are just a bad concept (jinxed).  But fortunately the large majority is quite good.  Reducing the frequency of the less interesting games would already go a long way to improve.

Overall, a definite recommendation, and hopefully the game will continue to improve.",True
"Honestly I was having fun for the first few days. Now it's a chore to play. Fall Ball is still the worst mini game, the game's ""lag compensation"" is ridiculously broken.

I was on fall mountain, first time I would've won the minigame, I jumped, touched the crown, and my guy just bounces off of it and someone else wins. This game won't last past season 2 imo.

Add to that, the random nature of how many people actually qualify per stage, and when the game uses a particular stage to widle down the number of those qualifying, and i just don't see how anyone could be stuck seeing ""the same 4 stages"" for more than the first 5 season levels.

Some levels are straight up unfair. And there are cheaters in every 1/4 games. Some/most maps have spots where people can ""troll"" others by blocking them and/or pushing the off.

"Let me preface this with some obvious facts before I hit the pros and cons. The game is VERY new and SIGNIFICANTLY more popular than the developers were ready for, so for the short term future we can expect some matchmaking hiccups here and there, and for problems to come and go, so that should not take away from the value of this game. 

So let's get into it.

Pros:
-Hilariously Fun
-The more people you play with, the more exponentially fun it it
-There is no pay to win
-99% of all content is available to players both casual and serious
-Season pass rewards do not cost real money, and your progression is earned without spending any extra money
-The game modes have some relative diversity, even in the early stages of release
-There is nothing to lose by not winning a match; just hop into the next one!
-Fun for all ages
-Still incredibly violent and competitive while being whimsical, cute, and family friendly
-Hugging strangers never felt more right

Cons:
-Expires relatively quickly playing solo
-New game = cheaters until devs can figure out a solution (which they are vocal about working on)
-A *couple* of game modes feel unwinnable because of mode-specific mechanics
-Some players are not there to win, just there to make sure you lose

End of the day? This game is beyond hilarious and so worth the money. I cannot wait to see what the next step in content will be, since newness comes so quickly with this dev team, and the game is never truly boring even without the newness. 9/10 would recommend.",True

"I have been addicted to this game ever since I got it. Really fun and chill to play, gotta get used to some of the mechanics and the maps at first because you will have some pretty competitive first rounds depending on your lobby but after a few games, you'll get used to it. The servers have yet to improve so any tail game will be two minutes of pure torture. Thank god each episode takes around 10 minutes to complete if you get to the final, which makes it so you don't feel like you wasted your time playing if you lose at the end.

It would also be best if they could follow how most games are starting to do it with a global notification with a players username when they get banned (they help reinforce the fact these people are getting banned). The problem used to be a lot rarer but now the game is gotten older and there seems to have been no updates to the anti cheat hackers are much more common and in my last 10 games (which has caused me to leave this review) only one had no hacker and the game lost connection during that one.

"I just picked it up and in the little time I have TRIED to play, it's been a horrible experience. 

1- Cheating is rampant. It's not as bad on the first few rounds, but on round 4 or 5 it's terrible, because that single person who didn't matter when there were 60 players, now knocks your qualifying chances by double digits, or you can't literally win at all (Flying in Hex-a-gone, for example).

2- If you ever get a team game, you might as well flip a coin to decide if you quit or not, because the game just went from skill based to random chance of being put on the winning team, or the one with the cheater(s).

3- In my last session, I got disconnected from the server about 5 times, which was half the time. What's worse is that your progress isn't counted at the end for Kudos or Experience. I got disconnected after losing in the final round of Hex-a-Gone, and it just booted me to the main screen, last ~10 minutes wasted.

I though this was a skill based game with a little chaos thrown in from the wonky physics and other players trying to troll you, but half the time the outcome is up to the RNG gods, and that gets boring real fast.

Sadly I have to give this a bad review for the time being because of the vast numbers of hackers flooding the games.
You get about 4/10 games you see cheaters. Jumping and/or running 4 times faster. Its pretty obvious and there is no good way to report them at this moment. You can easily just leave the match and find a new one, but that is pretty inconvenient. Specially when you are on the final stage and you see someone floating in the air above everyone else until everyone gets wiped out. Takes a lot of the fun out of it.

- No anti-cheat.
- Not enough mini-games, and the ones that are there are only semi-fun.
- Microtransactions.
- Team games are pure cancer with randoms.
- Below average amount of customization.
- Sometimes you won't get any rewards after a round, not even later.
- The fact that u will fall if someone slighty touches you is frustrating to say the least. 
- No way to play with friends only, even though this would be the perfect game for it.
- The shop doesn't refresh often enough.
- Grabbing mechanic is broken, some people grab you from meters away while i can't grab someone even if i can touch his pp.

"[h1] I made a longer, more in-depth video review here:
https://youtu.be/eUOYFO1BetQ [/h1]

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is already one of my favorite battle royale games of all time. Instead of having to kill people with weapons you find in random houses over the course of 45 minutes, you get to just be better than them at completely random, and silly minigames.

I've always loved custom servers for games like TF2 that had a bunch of minigames and this is just a fully fledged game for that idea and I love it.

I love the cotton candy aesthetic the game has along with the sugary sweet music and I love all the different ways you can customize your little jelly bean characters.

There is a good variety of minigames, and I can't wait until even more of them get added to make it even more fun.

If you have friends this game is a blast, though I will say if you are playing by yourself you might find it getting a little old after a couple of hours but if they keep adding more content that shouldn't be a problem.

Overall really happy with this game and I can't wait to see how it gets developed from here!

When searching for a match there are no audio cues that match has not been found. 
So while waiting you might be checking your phone etc, unaware that you haven't found a game. 

Menu is too slow navigating.

You can be having the best run ever, then get a team game where the enemy has more players then you, and 9 times out of 10 you will lose. It's very unsatisfying.

I cannot overstate how much of a missed opportunity this is because this steals away all of the meaningful moments from a gameplay and competitive perspective.. You do not get a chance to claw your way back to victory after a string of losses, you do not get to form friendships and rivalries throughout a hard-won tournament.

"Rather basic and very straightforward, the biggest ""challenge"" is avoiding other players slowing you down simply by being near you, which is nearly impossible with 60 players at the start of each match so a lot of it just comes down to luck, with little strategy for each course. Not every course is like this but many are, and I would enjoy this game a lot more if it was less crowded and if winning courses wasn't based primary on luck.

"Great game, but please please get rid or improve somehow the 'Fall Ball' level. Its so un-rewarding to play when your winning or losing.",True

Stupid funny and fun, seriously even losing is hilarious and I don't feel bad at all.
What a game, 12/10 would fall over again.",True

This kind of game to shake up the battle royale formula, and inspired by classic shows like Wipeout, is Genius!
Glad to hear that there will be more courses added in the future!",True
"Let's leave a negative review because servers are getting hit hard on day 1.
Let's leave a negative review preemptively because you fear the developers arent going to add more content.
Let's leave a negative review because your particular, skewed, and egocentric opinion wasnt addressed in this exact and specific way.

Pathetic.

The game is great fun at a budget price and the developers have good communication. Buy it, have fun, and refund it if you like crying into your pillow at night because you view yourself as the greatest video game reviewer and everyone else ""just doesnt understand"".",True
"Dev team, I think I'm falling for you",True
"Obviously more levels and skins will come in time as that for sure is some of what the game needs, but for what it's worth this game is a fun time with friends and will in time continue to expand on itself in the ""Japanese game show"" format it's been playing in. Of the games in my library this would for sure be on of the easier ones to pick up with three other friends, and as of now my only complaint is that those in your party who get out early have to sit and watch like it's waiting room simulator. 

This game just came out and already I personally believe it's underrated as of now.

EDIT*

Some of the minigames (such as the ball roller, or the grab registration for the tail ones) need fixing and even more random elements, I feel like a speedrunner now with how often i make it to the end, somethings gotta change to break up the monotony. Still a riot with friends.",True
"Just going to review this now, as ive gotten 12 hours out of the beta+this combined. TLDR: If you have interested in the 3d platformer genre and this sounds cool, its fun and worth getting, but currently is low on maps.

I will assume you have read a bunch of other things at this point, so will only go over big things.
-Currently the servers are getting smashed from launch. I will say have seen no problems during the beta for bugs or connectivity, so shouldn't be a problem long term.
+Coop is teams of 4 at most, where you are guaranteed to get put on the same team as your buddies, but if they lose on solo levels they are out(and can keep spectating).
-It has a cosmetics cash shop where you can buy fake game currency that you can also earn. Unsure as of now how fast you get said currency, but thats some points off in general considering the game isn't F2P.

The movement mechanics are simple, I wish they were a little more complicated(double jump or long jump) but I will say this game is not ""50% skill 50% luck"". There are situations where there is more luck involved than others- but I have been able to make it to round 3 the vast majority of the time by playing skillfully and understanding the levels.

Maximize your contribution in team games by seeing what role your team needs- make sure you aren't all on offense, or all on the ball/defending. When looking for tails or rings try and spread out so you aren't wasting your time blobbing. These are still where I lose the most, and where I am still learning a lot on how to play.

Right now the big problem is just not a lot of maps- I love the game and bought it and that is the big criticism that is going to make or break it for people who are interested. I would love to see some harder platforming challenges, and they have all of the tools/parts there. The plan is to add more, and that will be great if/when it happens, but I review it now so its a problem!

If this game dies in 2 months I will feel bad for the developers, but I will certainly have enjoyed my time with it! Was worth $20 for me.",True

Fun but please fix servers! Also custom lobby's with friends would be great or like team battles w/ friends and other team :D hopefully more content to come! :),True
[strike]fall[/strike] guys please stop grabbing me,True
"Fall guys is an original and sometimes raging kick on the Battle Royale genre. It brings a bunch of things to the table and treats the game almost like Mario Party. It also has a interesting physics engine kick to the game so the game is much funnier and harder. I recommend playing this with some of your friends, It's truly a hit. 

But this doesn't mean the game has no cons. The servers sometimes break down, there are multiple hackers, and sometimes the physics engine can glitch. 

But keep in mind, the game is in very early stages in it's development so there's going to be some problems. 

So I give the game a 9/10. Buy it and you won't regret it!",True
"Even excusing the lack of content, the game is fun enough. However, the game currently has a huge bug where every few games you get no reward. I thought this was annoying but harmless enough...

Until I won a round and got no rewards for it. No crowns, no experience, no nothing. Just a waste of the time and the effort it took to win.

This is a gigantic, game-breaking issue, and until this has a 0% chance of occurring, do not buy this game.",False

"Every match, last round, a hacker will fly over the map and grab the crown. No point of keeping it if I can never win. Product refunded.",False
"Consider what drew you to the game, for me it was because everyone in the game had the same abilities (I didn't have to memorize the abilities of 20+ characters to be good at the game), which produced an easy learning curve.

Cheaters literally take the thing that made the game good, and turn it against you. There is no recourse, I can't do anything unique with my character to mitigate cheating, but not being able to do anything unique with my character is what I've agreed to in order to have a game with an easy learning curve.  There is no report function either, there is literally nothing more you can do than lose.

Really, was nobody on the dev team thinking about this? Experiencing cheating in Fall Guys isn't like experiencing it in other games, it absolutely destroys the game and turns it's best feature against all other players.

I tried to get a refund for the game, but if you exceed 2 hours of play time they will not provide one.  I played for 7 hours, at least 2 of which were with cheaters.",False

"This is a negative review for a game that is good, but not for everyone. I honestly only see one problem with this game, but it's big enough for me to get a refund, and write this review as a warning : once again, this game isn't for everyone.

+ : The game is really good looking. The game looks charming and makes it obvious that you are playing a fun-oriented game.
+ : The music and the sound design in general is really nice.
+ : It's quite original, taking some things from the battle royal formula, with mini-games, but ...

- : ... if you care about winning, this game becomes actually incredibly frustrating, and not in a fun way. Some mini-games feel fun, because the skill actually matters, while other ones (team games, and some of the solo games) are sometimes lost from the very start. This would be fine if it was a more ""standard"" party game, where you can actually lose a round. But in this game, losing one round means getting eliminated, and having to start again.
This is my main issue with the game. I understand it can be a good, fun moment to spend with your friends, but the formula of the game makes you want to win, even though the gameplay makes it too random. There's strats, there's ways to get better ... but in the end, once everyone will learn these, the skill cap is too low, resulting in random, frustrating games.

I understand that the developpers wanted this game to be just good fun, not a competitive game. But the BR formula, and the shop (which is daily resetting, encouraging you to win multiple top 1 per day) make losing too frustrating.

I don't think the game is bad though, if you don't care about what I mentionned before, and if the game gets private servers, a map editor, and a few other things, it can become incredibly fun for non-competitive play.",False

"The game is addicting as hell and all, but as it is right now i cannot recommend this game to anyone.

There is ridiculously no way to report these players as you can't even see their name, and there is no report function. If your anti cheat doesn't work as well as it should then you need to let us see names and report people...

"Seen a lot of review bombs due to the servers being down. [b] This isn't one of those reviews [/b]

[b] I played the technical test a few days before this game came out so I'm not going to berate the developers on fixing/adding features that were pointed out with that test as it's only been one day, but I may mention them to keep my review honest and my review will include my opinions from the technical test as the game doesn't seem to have changed from what was displayed in it [/b]

I'm gonna lie there's a lot of elbow grease that needs to be applied to this game before I can look upon it as good, firstly please separate the Team game modes from the rest, it's all fun running episodes until you get to a round that requires ball control and the enemy team just obliterates you because your own has no synchronicity and you have to sit around 2 minutes to even get the awards from previous rounds. There's also several rounds where starting at the front of a pack genuinely influences your success more such as See-Saw and Crown Hill - you'll have to excuse me if I get the names wrong - which feel like you could genuinely leave most of the time or afk if you start at the back as you'll have better odds in the next game.

I've also been trapped by loose props in game modes such as the Door Buster which has prevented me from progressing in the stage. Whilst rare, this is especially annoying as it becomes completely out of my control.

Personally I find it a bit weird that there's a number of settings missing, specifically the ability to change my aspect ratio to one that would fit my screen but then again there's not that much of the screen the game could take up in a lot of areas.

Play with friends is quite fun, though again team modes should be segmented so that you can keep playing with your friends as opposed to them being knocked out and having to watch you through the rest of the rounds if you get through. This isn't that much of an issue but still one I feel dampens my time with my friends playing this game.

Honestly, I do believe this is a fun game but there's a lot of features that need to come in the next patch or two to make me keep this game in my library as I feel at the moment 70/30 on my investment here not being entirely worth it and that in a way upsets me because even though I do have fun with my friends, there are flaws in the game that have pushed me away from playing more episodes.",False

Character customization is very nice and you can make all types of combinations with patterns, colors, faces, and clothing, giving your fall guy a very stupid and funny appearance.
 The physics are good, but sometimes when you get in the middle of a lot of opponents, for no reason you will get lanched away, sometimes this will get you ""killed"", but if you're lucky you will get launched to 1st place.
It's a very cool and relaxing game that actually makes me laugh a little bit, which is why I was interested on it!",True
"The game in the beginning is fun but it becomes very repetitive very fast.
It needs more maps / game types. It also needs some kind of mode that disables team games. Speaking of team games, there are sometimes uneven teams. The servers at this time are not working well, but the developers are trying to fix this.

There are other smaller things like, kicking somebody from the group, making the spectator view automatically on your friends instead of some random player,…

Like I said the game is fun in the beginning but becomes very boring, very quickly.

There's a good variety of levels out right now and I'm sure the devs are also working on pushing out new content, for example adding more maps or gamemodes as this is only season 1. The controls are smooth and responsive and you can play with either a keyboard or mouse. The only little problem I had with the game is that you cannot skip the little cut scenes that occur when you loading into the map, I wish you were able to skip that.

At the moment they also removed names for Fall Guys on steam, because of some type of exploit that made the text on your name super big, but hopefully they will find a new solution to that soon, because as of now, everyone name is a variation of Fall Guys XXXX.

I play in the Asia region and it's very rare to get a game with no cheaters, and the fact that the devs have been lying about their anti-cheat and how it works is even more frustrating.
They claim that cheaters will get banned after one game, but that's not true at all. Sometimes they're in my next game, and almost all of the cheaters have items that you need crowns to get.

"Full of bots and buggy.
Terrible and unethical practice by the developers: adding bots to fill up the game. Yes, every game has 60 players, but on average, you only play against other 15 - 20 human players, and the remaining 45-40 players are plain and simple bots added by the developer to make you feel like you are in a big multiplayer ""battle royale"". Why they do this when they have thousands of players? Well, simple, to reduce costs. It is way cheaper to have multiple lobbies/instances of a game with fewer human players connected than having fewer lobbies/instances with a big number of human players connected. They earned millions with sales, but greed is bigger than that.

Those bots didn't pass the most basic of the Turin tests. The patterns and how they behave are so obvious, so predictable. So after a few rounds, the ""players"" that are being dropped (didn't qualify to advance) are the bots. At the final two rounds, you are mostly playing against human players, and that's when the rounds only have between around 12 players, and the final round only 6.

There's always some evil behind. The developers have been questioned already about this in social media and they have dodged to answer those concerns.  Also, they have provided vague and weird answers when asked about adding ""social"" features to the game (besides the limit of 4 players per party) as a way to interact with the rest of the ""60 players"" of the game... well, it is tricky to ""socialize"" with a bot, right? =)

Still fun though, let's hope they remove the bots. But unfortunately, bot-filled games are becoming the new normal.",False

"The games actually extremely addictive despite two glaring flaws.
The main reason for this negative review
1. CHEATERS, they're incredibly frequent to the point where it un-motivates me to even play and it's the main reason why it's hard for me to recommend the game right now. They also make crown currency items non rewarding at all since anyone could basically cheat for it at ease because this game literally has no type of anti-cheat software in it.

And, the other flaw, which doesn't break the game but is annoying nonetheless.
2. Teambased minigames, it ruins the whole ""battle royal"" aspect of the game since it's basically at random if you'd win any of these despite how hard you try. In my opinion there should be a separate gamemode for this.

Other than the two problems I see listed above, I'd say this game is awesome and alot of silly fun! I think the pricetag is reasonable as well.",False
"Enjoyed the Beta as it was something a bit different but underwhelmed now that it has launched.

The same maps / layouts appear to be used over and over at the expense of the others and no way of selecting the type of map you want to play.

Not suffered any server issues and the game is easy enough to pick up and play. If you have a group of friends who are going to play it then it's worth a go but if you are playing solo then I'd say wait for more content or a cheaper price. The main thing about the game is that it's more about the laughs than getting better at the game.

In my case the chances of losing games due to a hacker are simply high enough to ask for a refund. A random hacker or two wouldn't really be an issue in another kind of game, but in a ""Last man standing"" game it's not acceptable.",False

Game is complete dog shit. All RNG and most maps are fuckin dumb and make no sense. This game is suppose to be fun but kids wanna try their dicks off and ruin the enjoyment of the game for everyone else. Some game modes make me want to shank myself multiple times.

"This game has a ton of potential.  The concept is simple and easy: compete in mini game events and try not to be eliminated.  However since the game's launch I've found myself disliking this game more and more.  

The most difficult part of completing the challenges is not the obstacles, the timed jumps, the rising slime, or even the other players trying to sabotage you.   The most difficult part of this game is the other players that AREN'T trying to sabotage you.  Your character in this game has zero ankle strength.  If you jump and don't touch anyone there is a really good chance you will just fall over.  You barely tapped into someone on accident? On the ground again.  It's nearly impossible to stay on you feet even without everyone else in the game making the obstacles more frustrating than fun.  

Tail Tag is a game type that needs to go away.  You have a minute and a half to grab a tail from other players and have it when time runs out.  Which means you have a minute and 20 seconds to do nothing.  Then grab a tail.  Total waste of time.

Any and all team games are also boring and don't depend on your skill in the game.  As the title would suggest they depend on how well you work as a team.  Anyone that has played online games ever knows that working together as a team with random people online never works.

One day this game might reach its potential but until then I'd recommend staying away from this hype train.",False
"Lag, spawn placement, stiff/unresponsive controls, and poor level design mean that skill is not the deciding factor of who wins the final crown.

"Bought this for me and my wife. She likes it, however it frustrates me every time I play it. I am good at most of the obstacle courses, where skill is rewarded, but the team games are largely luck based, and a good portion of the other maps are aswell, one unlucky door-pick can set you behind permanently. Or when theres only one route through and it turns into a mosh pit where you will be trampled like its black friday and end your run. Many of the mini-games are just tedius or boring. Feels like playing the same 6 maps over and over. Playing with friends doesnt feel like your playing together at all, you hardly get the chance to notice your friends let alone interact with them at all. Nothing satisfying about the game really. I only play anymore (occasionally) because I wanna feel like I got my moneys worth.  I wish I could get a refund.",False

"Server refresh rate is actually like 30hz aka unplayable. There is so much desync, i can't even count the amount of times i lost last round or minigames to people who were behind me but the server says different. This isn't a very big issue until you start missing out on wins because of it. Not only is the server refresh rate unplayable, team games need to be removed because its just random chance. If you get matched with a bad team its out of your control and you lose through no fault of your own. The amount of variety is minimal too. once you play about 20 full games you've seen all the minigames. Granted the new update added some variety with levels now having random objects which is very refreshing but there needs to be more base minigames. This is not a bad game by any means but there needs to be more, so i would recommend to wait and see if season 2 is better and if not wait til season 3.",False

I also feel the design of earning crowns via wins is fueling the rampant cheating. Like I expect some cheaters in any game, people like to win and don't care how. But having one type of currency you earn only by winning is a strong encouragement to cheat.

I think the game would be better if you earned 1 crown for every round you qualified, and then like 10 on a win. 
Then inflate the cost of crown costumes to compensate for that influx. 
This would allow more players to be apart of that economy without resorting to cheating.",False

"This game is cute as hell, full of vibrant colors, and has a wonderful idea behind it.

""But you gave it a negative review, what gives?"" 

Let me tell you: It sucks, and here's why:

1. No anti-cheat. I was one of those that laughed at people crying cheaters on the forums until I saw it for myself; players flying up in the air for no reason, avoiding any danger and flying straight to the finish line within seconds. This first reason alone speaks volumes to me because it says Mediatonic didn't care enough about the games lifespan to invest any money in protecting it and its players from abuse.
2. No custom names. I get some people like to throw out offensive names on display now and then, but censoring every active player by shackling them with ""Fall Guy 1234"" is uncalled for and says more about the developers than it does about the players. I got a suggestion for you, Mediatonic: Add a report feature that includes both cheating and offensive name; problem solved, and I'm not even paid to come up with these brilliant ideas.
3. You don't have to lose over player error, the game will lose for you. This one I have to go in-depth on because I understand it looks like a ""git gud"" situation. Your character flops around like a jellybean, which I completely understand. What I don't understand however is why a slight hop a couple feet off the ground justifies sending your character falling on his back without bumping into anyone else, to which you spend the next few seconds mashing buttons for them to recover (which doesn't work, you're just annoyed at this point). Speaking of recovery time, the developers figured in a fast-paced round elimination game it'd be a grand idea to make your character falling over even slightly take several seconds just to get up. There's 60 people in the beginning, why make us spend precious time recovering needlessly when we could be rushing to the end of the map? I see this as lazy programming that they figured it'd be cute for people to see instead of trying it for themselves to see how much of an annoyance it is. Along with that, the maps have a chance of bugging out, making you plummet into the white void below as you reached the final stretch of touching that glorious golden crown.
4. Map variety. I was told there were 10 game modes for my $20 spent; I have yet to see more than half of them because the games falsely randomized algorithm chooses only a couple maps to suit its tastes instead of letting you access the full content. Let players vote on maps or add more because there's not enough content accessed to that justifies the price, as low as it appears to be.

In conclusion, I feel like I was ripped off by a bait and switch. This game is not at all what people claim to be, or what the videos make it off to be; it's a shameless cash grab that I, like others, have fallen prey to, and I hope the developers either make fast changes, or feel the heat of cheating consumers out of a fair product. I felt the need to write this because this game became immensely popular while being a two-faced jackal in reality, and this lack of quality led me to apologize to the person I gifted the game to for us to play together. 

Wait for improvements, or steer clear entirely since they probably won't own up to their faults. You've been warned.

Game sucks thanks,True
this game would be even more fun if the team minigames werent fucking horrendous,True
"8/10 but in it's current state, basically a 3/10 or less depending on the match you get. 

Fall guys is what you get if you mash Mario Party, Gang Beasts and TV Game Shows with contestants running obstacles to race to the finish. 

Some good things about Fall Guys: 
It's incredibly fun and accessible. The game play is simple. Jump, Grab, Dive, and Move. Qualify and win each mini game until you are the last Fall Guy standing. With your Kudos (purple currency gained by playing the game) and Crowns (currency gained by being the last Fall Guy standing) you can get cosmetics from the store to dress up your Fall Guy. They're very cute, and there are tons of costumes and combinations to choose from. 

The mini games are pretty short, 2 minutes each roughly, and with varying difficulty. Some mini games are simple memory tests, while others can be difficult platforming sections with simple jumps, dodging wrecking balls while slipping around on purple goo, jumping over a tube that's trying to push you, ""tag"", and more. 

There are also team games with Red, Blue, Yellow and Green as the colors. You work together with a group of Fall Guys to fight over which team is eliminated. Usually the team with the least amount of points is the team that is eliminated, turning the game into ""punish the weakest link"" strategy. If team Red and Blue have higher points than team Yellow, it is in Red and Blue's best interest to keep the balls, or eggs, outside of Yellow's side / nest. 

All in all, I'd definitely recommend this game as just a fun little time waster you can play for 10 minutes, or hours depending on how much you like it. When I first bought this game I severely enjoyed it, especially with friends. You can take it easy and play it casually or try your best to learn speed strategy, using obstacles to your advantage, and ways to trip up other players to gain an advantage over them. I do not believe there is a ""wrong"" way of playing this game if you're truly having fun with it!

That said. 

Major flaws: 

There doesn't seem to be any way of reporting players that are hacking or cheating in Fall Guys. In the steam version of the game, you only get a list of numbers, so you can't find the steam ID in order to file a complaint against people who hack / cheat for Crowns. 

I normally do not write out many reviews but I love and hate this game because it's ruined by cheaters. My last 5 games have had cheaters in them. 

Making their Fall Guy float above the stage on modes like Hex - A - Gone or Roll Out, where the objective of the mini game is to survive until enough Fall Guys fall into the slime below. 

Having their Fall Guy float, with speed, above the stage on race mode stages like Whirlygig, Slime Climb, Tip Toe and Fall Mountain, placing first within seconds. 

Having their fall guy float, with speed, into the balls on Fall Soccer and other mini games alike. 

Getting a tail and floating above the stage until the round ends. 

It's so rampant that the game is unplayable on PC. There's a hacker in every game, and it doesn't matter if they are blatant or not because we have no way of reporting them.

My advice is to wait until they address the issue with hackers / cheaters before buying as it is FRUSTRATING to sit through 5 rounds only to lose INSTANTLY on Fall Mountain to someone who blatantly hacks. 

Fall Guys happens to be both an extremely fun game both casually and if you have a competitive side. I could not recommend it enough, with a caveat: The game is only fun without hackers / cheaters. If it's a fair match, it's just a barrel of laughs and hype!

"the game is amazing and bring alot of laughs and you get happy playing it, but some minor updates would make it more enjoying with your friends. for example when you are in a group u should automatically spectate your friends if you get eliminated, and when you que for game as a group u see ur frind falling with you and things like that. thank you for a awesome game!",True

"it is gud but team games suck and so does the yellow team
",True
"Mario Farty with lag. Until there's either more content, or better netcode for games like Egg Scramble, you wont know which to be more annoyed at; your teammates, or the ghost who grabbed you that probably was a teammate anyway.

As far as design goes, its fun, with some odd choices that could be changed to remove a lot of frustration. Royal Fumble wouldn't feel so bad if there wasn't horrible netcode, an internal timer on grabbing the tail again, and a player starting with the tail. The tail isn't out there in the course to get, someone just starts with it. And if they leave the game with it, no one wins. You don't accrue score for holding the tail over the course of two minutes, it only matters who has it when those two minutes are up, rendering the first 70% (I'm being generous) of the round nearly pointless. All tail games are this way.

For a party/casual game like this, you would expect some sort of risk reward system, but there isn't. No power ups on the side of the courses like in mario kart. No incentive to have the tail if you're in that mode, as it does not make you faster or slower, or have any effect at all. The courses are easily exploitable, which does not lend to a higher skill ceiling. In slime climb, theres shortcuts. But in block party, you can actually just opt out of the round and not participate by jumping onto the side of the course. If you're in a team game, you could walk away from the keyboard for a snack, and have about the same impact. Its easier to sabotage your teammates than help them.

There's way more skins than courses. Can't blame them for having a business model, but considering you're expected to play the rounds so many times, there isn't nearly enough courses to keep you interested. There's seemingly four tiers of game course types depending on size of lobby remaining, and three to four different maps in each tier. You blow through them all after in a few hours of play. Seeing as the maps are constructed out of base pieces of blocks, having more maps is conceptually easy. Its the kind of thing that would explode if opened up to the community as custom maps.

There is no custom game mode, or party lobby, or practice mode. There is just starting the game against everyone else, with your group if you like. But no party mode where just you and your friends have a Hex-a-Gone tournament. Nothing like that. If youre even grouped up with your friends, spectator mode actually has less indication of who your friends are than when you're running the course. When youre on the course, your friends have an arrow over their head. In spectator, there is nothing. And it doesnt default your spectate camera to a teammate. You have to frantically click through the entire lobby to find them.

And finally, technical nit-picks. If you play mouse and keyboard, the cursor is always on your screen. You can bring up the Esc menu to remove it, but you have to do it each lobby. You can't leave a lobby unless you've eliminated yourself. If you're eliminated in a team game, you can not leave the lobby until the next course begins. That means you sit through the already lengthy and plentiful loading screens to watch others have fun instead of you; even if you're solo with no teammates in the game.",False

REMOVE UNEVEN TEAM GAMES. NO ONE WANTS TO LOSE A 4v5 BECAUSE YOUR POORLY THOUGHT-OUT ALGORITHM THINKS 9 PLAYERS SHOULD PLAY A SOCCER GAME.

Finally, tweak the physics slightly on PC and GREATLY on PS4. Game is almost unplayable on PS4 with how jumping on even the slightest incline causes your character to have a stroke and start spasming on the floor (PS4), or touching someone else's toe when jumping has ~20% chance to topple your character (PC)

"I absolutely love this game. I played the beta last weekend and enjoyed it then, too, but couldn't put a finger on [i] why [/i] I enjoyed it so much... Then when I was playing in the last couple days it hit me: One of the funniest things ever is toddlers falling down, and at its core, that's what this game is -- toddlers running, arms slightly elevated for optimum balance, and completing MXC-style obstacle courses, with lots of grabbing and falling.

Even some of the modes that aren't my favorite like the tail-grabbing one don't tilt me when I lose. It has that Rocket League feel of ""Just one more game!"" and as long as you don't take the game more seriously than it takes itself, it's just fun, even if you choose to interject a more competitive nature into it. 

I definitely have already gotten my money's worth and while I greatly hope that the devs keep adding content, rotate events, make tweaks, and most importantly add a thumb costume, I greatly enjoy what this game already is. It's also one of those games that as other games I want to play release, I can still fall back on this one for a good time, potentially for years to come.",True

"This game will get an eventual thumbs down if they don't fix a few things:

- Team games must go.

- Any game requiring grab mechanics either needs fixing or binning (Egg Scramble, Tail Grab)

- Physics in general need improving, both for collisions and ball games.

In general, there just needs to be more variety and originality in the game modes. But even then, they could replace the awful game modes like Tail Grab and Egg Scramble with more generic race type games and the game would be all the more better for it",True

"Don't let the poor reviews fool you -- it is fully fleshed out as a game that already provides plenty of content to last the month. The matchmaking a few hours after launch was pretty much instantaneous, the only times it wouldn't let me in a game was when I tabbed out of game or the devs brought the server down. From my perspective, this is a great start to a multiplayer battle royale game from Mediatonic. It brings to the table an easy controller/keyboard layout and a decent skill ceiling sure to test the patience of veteran BR gamers. The bright colors and poppy soundtrack keep me glued to the screen, and I don't mind spectating my friends when I lose because of it. I'm also surprised at the fact they chose to avoid in-game chat as well as voice, because I can see flame wars erupting amongst the people for simply grabbing them.

Your objective in the game is to do a minigame of sorts (there's about 4 per game) and to get the crown on the last round. The crown itself can be used as a currency to buy exclusive skins, emotes, patterns, color schemes, you name it, also the in-game store cycles every two days or so, there's a second row that cycles a little faster.

!! IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE QUALITY OF YOUR GAME WHATSOEVER !!

"Ended up playing this game from its midnight release, to 5AM with a bunch of buds; We were having a blast the whole time.
The game's biggest strength is probably its variety; Stuff like soccer or capture the flag (or tail in game) breaks up your standard platforming stages really well.

There's a few things I'd love to see added, such as the ability to change the color of certain costumes to the pallettes you see in team games, or features to cater to lobbies with you and your buds. For whatever reason it doesn't highlight the people you joined a lobby with which makes them really hard to find when spectating, since it defaults the camera to some rando.

Either way, the game is already a heavy reccomendation from me; It's cool to see a battle royale in the format of a party game.",True
"Overall, i give it 7.5/10 on launch day. I expect this to improve as time goes on. So far I've been having fun with it, and yes i realize there are some issues, including severe ones that i have also experienced. However, most of these issues are clearly common launch day issues most games, especially online games, inevitably face. Overloaded servers being the main issue leading to other problems such as failure to receive rewards, and getting disconnected.

Setting aside the negatives, this game is a fun 60 player ""battle royale"", where you participate in a series of arenas and challenges to ultimately be crowned as the winner among 59 other players. Decent number of maps and cosmetics bought with currency earned in-game combine to create a unique and silly experience for every match.",True
"For $20, a fun time that keeps you laughing round after round. Sure, it has its technical matchmaking challenges, but honestly - that is to be expected for a new game at launch. Devolver delivered a solid v1 product for a reasonable price. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us with future content updates.",True
"I've never been a fan of the battle royale genre, mainly because I play games casually, for fun, and quite frankly suck at a lot of high-skill games. Fall Guys introduces a battle royale that is just plain silly and entertaining, and if you happen to win then that's just a bonus. My group of friends and I played it extensively on the last beta weekend, and even the crabbiest among us was able to have fun.

The game is cute and colorful, which is obvious if you've looked at any of the promos for it. The avatars feel a bit like weebles, and there are sometimes balance issues, but that often ends in hilarious results. Some of the mini games are quite challenging, and depend a great deal on luck, so be prepared for that. The cosmetic items are super fun, and I'm eager to collect them all. You can play with up to 3 other people in your group, and I definitely recommend doing that because it helps with the team games a lot when you can coordinate some. Having said that, I have also played solo and the experience was still quite enjoyable.

I realize that this launch hasn't gone smoothly, with the server issues and all, but I guarantee you, the game is worth the wait. Give it a chance. You don't want to pass up the experience of a video game version of Wipeout on an acid trip, with friends. Now excuse me, I have a hot dog costume to collect.",True
"alright now that the servers have evened out more I'll say my final piece. A truly amazing game that's damn near ruined with the pointless inclusion of ""team modes"" like egg snatch and fall ball where you can't communicate with your team yet everything depends on teamwork. It sucks and damn near ruins the game, but luckily they're like 20% of the shuffle. They really need to be taken out and put in their own mode, because they're game ruining and suck ass. alright last review, I played more and there's a bug that forces you to spectate unless you hard reset the game which is infuriating and the more I play team matches the more I hate it. I'll recommend once there's a different playlist for team modes/mixed",False

"Fall guys is bullsh*t. Glorious, chaotic, fantastic bullsh*t. You will see your own teammates for some ungodly reason do more harm than good for your team, you will have people who will tackle you when you are in a desperate race against another Fall Guy for the last qualifying place so you both lose. You will have jank physics screw you over. And no matter how nice you want to play, the time will come when you will taste blood and push other poor Fall Guys to their doom down the slime because the opportunity just appeared.    

Like I said, Fall Guys is bullsh*t, the best kind of bullsh*t. No other game is both hilarious and infuriating at the same time and for the same reason. The fact that nobody actually made a similar game before is kind of weird. 

Could it need more levels? Sure, but that's a given that it will come in time. 

Could it need some randomization on the current levels? Sure, that might also come (C'mon I dare you to put slime on random spinning wheels in ""dizzying heights"" each time). 

Could it need a custom level editor and a separate game mode where those end up? Wouldn't say need, but it might be the final step that would make this game live pretty much forever.",True

Anyway its a good game",True
good game despite server issues at launch. race and survival modes are fun. team games gotta go though. they just arent fun. also we need a better party system and larger party sizes. this game is one you would want to play with large groups of friends,True

"Hands down the best Battle Royale/Knockout game I have ever played! Great fun solo or with up to 3 friends (4 players in a group). It is hilariously good and a breath of fresh air away from the more serious games in the BR category. 

Well worth the investment! I highly recommend this game to everyone.

"Very funny battle royale based on rounds with mini-games, 60-players in the first round, narrowing down to a single winner.

"After playing some rounds you will start noticing some people running faster, suddenly gaining some height at missed jumps and similar things. Some of the more extreme guys will just run or fly straight to their goal or float around until all other players are knocked out.

As long as no report system or anti-cheat measures are implemented it is not worth playing, even if the game itself can be fun.",False

"God tier. Basically the movement mechanics of gang beasts, but insanely fun gameplay. Definitely recommend",True
such a fun game especially with friends but team mini games should be a separate gamemode.,True
"What a breath of fresh air! 

I had way way way more fun with this than I thought I would and I think I'm hooked. The controls are smooth, (I use controller as many have advised), I LOVE the colors, physics, levels, skins, textures, reward systems, and random chaos. The game play is so streamlined that you just jump in and go which I appreciate. Fall Guys is a simple concept executed well and that should not be overlooked. It's clear to me that this was made with love. It's a blast, worth my money, and I suggest giving it a go if you're into random colorful messes of bumbling chaos.

Overall, this bean boi is a solid piece of work. I haven't got bored yet because of how brutally challenging  and unforgiving the gameplay can be. I keep coming back for more.

The music is good but I especially appreciate slappin' beefy bass riffs in the loading menu- perfection. 
Devs, we need more beefy slappin' bass riffs! 

I know there have been crashing/server issues, but I am lucky enough to have only experienced a couple of crashes so far. Yeah, it was annoying, but it wasn't a make or break deal especially since they've made it very clear that they're working on the server issues, so I knew going into the game that this could be a factor especially with it being so new. I just decided to do something else for a while. I came back after a couple hours and all was well. 

Thanks for such a fun, addictive game, Mediatonic!

Just when I thought Devolver was a crown jewel in this tangled garbage pile of oversaturated, overdone, undercooked sludge of AAA titles and tired gimmicks, Yet again, they have ceased to amaze me by publishing this slam dunk.

"I love this game but the team games and the tail game leave a lot to be desired.
the tail game specifically is rigged and the best way to play is to do nothing until the very end, I highly recommend changing this game from last person with the tail to most time with the tail as it encourages players to become more skilled.",True
"This game is an absolute blast! Most of the minigames are fun, and the games go quick. At the moment the servers are having some trouble, but they're working on it. definitely worth the buy.",True
"So, in short:

-Game is fun
-Team games are meh
-Still probably needs some work

ITS VERY GOOD I LOVE IT ITS BETTER THAN LITTLEWOOD,True
"ok its back up, but how about make it so the goddamn fall ball team game is not an option when teams are unbalanced ok!!

hey gotta another comment - make the final tail game like halo oddball instead of whoever has it last. its just afk for a minute then start playing when 30 seconds are left the game rika digga dog o na fishbowl",False
sick game really fun,True
"I'm what you might call a more hardcore/competitive gamer/no-lifer and I got dragged into playing this game by my fiancée. I'm pleasantly surprised. It's got that battleroyale competitive feel to it but you don't have to take it so seriously and you can still have fun.  You can laugh at yourself failing which isn't something many games do too well.

I expected to maybe give the game an hour before I got bored, even warned her that it didn't seem like my kind of game, but actually it's pretty fun.

In terms of the launch, four of us were on discord chatting for about 6 hours and we probably got about 2 hours worth of games played total.  Not a great start and I can see why people who were solo queuing would be pissed off, but... C'mon, is this your first Day 1 Launch?  Get over it, try again tomorrow.",True

"The game has tons of potential, but at the moment it's not worth your money. 

1. Needs more content. it gets boring very quickly. Maybe include custom or stage building modes.  
2. On the same note of not having content, maybe stop locking skins and whatnot behind a pay wall. There isn't much to begin with even though you pay a pretty penny. You also need to wait for a rotation in the store. 
3. Team games are no fun. You can play like a champ all game, but once you get a team, you can lose (especially if it's only two teams competing with one another). 
4. Tail grab should not be an end game.",False
"The game is brilliant, but the hackers make it not worth while. I almost get into every finals but its pointless as i'll see someone dashing through, yes there are insane number of hackers and company is working more on cosmetics and season 2 rather than fishing the anti cheat system. Whats worse is you end up with a bad taste in mouth since you cant even report the hacker. The website claims, that the hackers are being taken care off, while I see the same hacker 3 times in a row. Hacking will be the downfall of the game, not lack of skins. Just like pubg.",False
good game but not worth its price $20,True
"Fall Guys is an interesting beast. 

First of all, I'll say they priced this game right. $20 is like two medium pizzas from Dominos plus tip and delivery fee. This game is worth about that much.

I recommend it on the caveat that you should play with friends if you want to actually enjoy yourself for any length of time. Outside of that, I have some gripes.

The controls are floaty and imprecise, which is on brand for the style of game they are selling. It's a frantic, mad house, run for your life and laugh at the chaos type of game. Laser-precise controls wouldn't make sense. Your guy takes some time to start and stop moving, and he falls over and trips with seemingly no outside influence sometimes. Others trample you and shove you accidentally (or intentionally) off the platforms when you all are running towards the same place. Many surfaces you need to traverse are round and have a 2cm wide place where you can move safely without falling off. 

The entire experience is frustrating and infuriating, all the while it is hilarious and enjoyable. That's why I say you need to play with friends. You can laugh with each other about getting screwed, or cheer for one another as your friend makes it to the finale and then you all scream and howl with laughter as he gets beamed across the level by the spinny bar at the end and barely misses 1st place. 

This game is enjoyable, but please take a friend.",True
"Very cool game with bouncy beans. There once was a time there were flying beans, but I haven't seen those since the great bean war. I wonder where they went? 10/10.",True
"Don't get me wrong, i like the concept but it gets bored over time. if it was $5, i would definitely love it",False
Great game - some stages are very boring though. Good potential if it gets updated!,True
"A family friendly mini-game competition!

Graphically identical to many Unity engine games such which leaves little to make this distinctive in the modern game market.

Soundtrack is minimalistic yet pleasant.

Gameplay is fun, though you will (at this time) find many hackers on this game using such things as 'Fly Hacks' where you will see multiple players flying through the air all the way to the end over all obstacles.  There is no in-game reporting and filing a report is cumbersome.

Overall, the title is a cool idea but is really small for what it offers, you will find yourself playing the same 10 maps over and over.

Get this title only on sale and with friends.",True
This game is addicting.,True
"One of the better games with a battle royal system based on Takeshi's castle! its recomended, there it some first day server issues but dont forget this is the first game this indie game has made, well worth the time and give it a try!",True

It is filled with hackers and you can't report them.,False
I don't like the attention I get when I have the tail.,True
"the game
",True
In 90 minutes I saw more hackers than in my whole GTA 5 career. Tell me when this game gets an anticheat.,False
"Be careful what you wish for.

The developers have patched the game recently to adjust the frequency you play a team game twice now after receiving community feedback, which has made the game extremely repetitive. They made it so you cannot play two team games in a row, and, on top of that; team games will not appear when the resulting teams would be uneven.

What this boils down to is if you do not see a team game by round 2, you will have a max of 1 game per episode. If that one game follows a map of lets say Slime climb  that does not have a fixed number of qualifying players and you end up with odd, you will not see a team game at all.

If you have any experience with platformers at all, the remaining games, obstacle courses or challenges that are redundant of obstacle courses (or the memory picture game) will pose no real challenge to you, and you will play 3-4 of them before you queue into the finale; or play a team game at round 4 where it's probably the most frustrating to you if you advocated for these changes.

A typical episode now is one of the intro obstacle courses, into another obstacle course, and, pending the remaining players, one of the simple survival challenges. The game was much more charming when I couldn't already work out what would come next, and objective based modes are way more fun here. Right now I don't have any fun up until the finale, which now occasionally takes place on the third round, likely a result of all these changes.

I have ten wins for context; and  while it is true that I make it to the finale more easily, that really isn't the point of this game. I was winning team games way more often than I wasn't, and they were the highlight of the comical moments.

I wish they'd waited more than a few weeks to make these changes. With the game's popularity, I hope they add different queue's to cater to different preferences; or that new maps that follow have varied objectives. Obstacle courses are a major bore when they're the only thing you do.",False
So basically you just fall endlessly in a loading screen. That's it.,True
"For a game that cost money and is full release, the game is full of cheaters and HUGE bugs. The grab mechanic.... holy shit the grab mechanic is the worst thing ever, for some reason half the players get basically infinite reach (and can reach behind them and fifty feet above them?). I can be right behind someone and not grab them, or I do grab them and don't get the tail????? Seriously fix one of the 2 fucking mechanics in your game, it can't be that hard to fix literally one mechanic",False

but unfortunately it's not... and I'll tell you why
except that it's full with hackers, bad servers and many bugs

it's all just about stupid skins that don't help you at all, everyone just plays for it, not because the game is fun...",False
"The game was fun, i ran it on Linux trough Proton but with the new easy anti cheat its just not working any more, that so shitty.",False
"To start off this review i wanna say that i love this game and have been playing it since beta and i hope this game succeeds even more than it has. BUT in the current state of the game i cant recommend it at all. This game has a huge hacker problem that isnt being dealt with and is really killing the game for alot of players. This game has a terrible anti cheat to where its pretty much non existent as people can go win 100s of games and not get detected. The second biggest issue is the lack of variety and quality in gamemodes, as every game after around 20 hours of gameplay will start to feel boring as you get the same couple gamemodes alot. The quality of gamemodes are also not great and are sometimes frustratingly designed such as see saw and perfect match,tail tag and the team gamemodes. Im praying that season 2 overhauls this game and makes it as great as it could be,



TLDR: Hackers and the lack of anti cheat are killing the game and poorly designed gamemodes will push people away after lots of playtime. Dont buy until season 2 overhaul",False

"Fun game, that's just ruined by cheaters. Not so bad at first, but apparently there is some sort of matchmaking going on once you get a few wins. Now half the games I get into have at least one cheater in it. Will change my review if they ever get a system in place to prevent them, but for now I'm done until a fix is implemented.",False
This game is extremely luck based. I played a total of 6 games and in every lobby their was at least one or more hackers. Also the game is repeatative and boring. It’s not worth the $20 price tag it should be priced at $5. I only had 15 minutes worth of fun before it became boring.,False

"Don't buy this game, at least not till they fix it. Riddled with hackers, you'll never win matches for crowns. Games get repetitive after a few hours. Not worth the current price tag. I'm sure that the player base will die out in a few weeks if the hacks keep going. It sucks because this game can be fun when it is.",False
"Got this game, was fairly fun to begin with. The game is now ruined by a massive amount of hackers, and a lack of proficient Anti-Cheat from the Developers. During the ""first wave"" of hackers, Mediatronic did not allow those who wished to file reports on players that were cheating, making their already obsolete anti-cheat even more redundant. 
Mediatronic now allows players to file reports, knowing full well their anti-cheat is lackluster.  

If you feel like wasting your money on something that doesn't work well, and forces you to quit out due to lack of anti-cheat, this is the game for you!./
Pros; Fun party game you can play with your friends
Cons; You'll likely encounter a hacker for every 2 games you play, making you quit out.",False
It's fun if you like being angry xx,True
Feels like I'm driving a beach ball.,True
Really fun! But it does need more maps/activities for $20...,True
"This is just a short review for now, but I just can't hold it back anymore of how many problems exist still. 
Glitches, cheats, and lag are as wild as the gameplay. This is a very fun, addicting game, but there are a lot of B.S. issues. I have rarely hated and loved a game as much as this one...I rarely post a negative game review.
BUT, with the plaguing issues (like no other games I can think of), I can't recommend it. It is online only and they need to get a more fair and balanced network packet timing figured out of the game before I can consider it worth my money.  You can work your little heart out to win, but you will see many questionable moments that are often funny, but fun-busting and frustrating.

The first several days to a week were a pain too with server issues.  Random lag issues exist still, and some disconnections, which I do not notice in other games where EVERY split second counts.  For someone to still your tail when they are over a  full character length away is a regular problem I see. Your tail gets stolen when you should be in the clear ( I don't have slow internet either).  

Hacking even existing is not something I give a pass on either.  The programmers need to know their game and how to prevent this, but it still goes on.  Once  I'd experienced and seen this happening more, it was too late for a refund. The couple hours that Steam allows had already passed.  So, a broken, buggy game they get to keep my money. So, I keep playing it to at least make it worth my money, because a lot of the levels are still fun.  I haven't smashed my controller against the wall yet, but I have enough restraint to not do so. This is the game that is likely linked to more smashed TVs, controllers, and other nearby objects than most others.

I would give this game a 7 out of 10 overall, but for the fun-breaking bugs and hacking, I want to give it a 5 out of 10. 

If you decide to own the game, be prepared for being pulled into it, but also be prepared to lose some hair and have some broken stuff as well.  ""Play at your own risk"", is an understatement.",False
"What I like about this game:
The menu music. It is 10/10. But it is the only aspect of the game I have been able to experience.

What I dislike about this game:
The fact that it is more of an animated back drop that plays music and says searching for match.

Side notes:
Could be called Searching for Match Simulator",False
"Game is great and fun, fun alone, fun with friends. However apparently the game is coded in such a way that most parameters run entirely client side, enabling simple basic cheats/hacks to be used. Worse is that Mediatonic lied about cheaters being automatically banned. There is no such thing.

In the past week, half my games had cheaters making it almost impossible to win and the cheating issue is only getting worse as time goes by.",False
"Alot of cheaters!! Every match at least one, they cant be knocked off and come the last round instantly win.. dont see anything done to stop this practice and the report page basically discourages the reporting of it... sad and ruins the fun silly point of the game, you are playing to never win unless you also cheat.",False
"This game is so overhyped. The replayability of this game is the worst I have seen out of any game. (exaggerated) Most of the levels are basically the same, and the team rounds are stupid. AND its 20 bucks. I could get 3.33 Travis Scott meals from my local McDonalds and I would STILL have less regret then buying this terrible game. The art is fine, the music is ok, but the gameplay is only fun for 1 hour. I hate JimJim for telling me to get it.",False
"This game was a ton of fun for the first few weeks but now cheaters are so rampant that the game is nearly unplayable. There is at least one cheater in at least 1/3 of my games, which makes winning impossible and completely ruins the fun of the game. I would not suggest buying this game until they implement a robust anti-cheat system.",False

"Ok game. Very repetitive with a strange lack of content considering the levels don't seem all that complicated to design or build. With a lot of levels using the same assets and objects, i think using the things that already exist in the game to make a few more unique levels would have been pretty easy. Such as a tug-of-war type team game level on a single large seesaw, or a team race to get a soccer ball to the end of a track. Those are just off the top of my head, but you get the point. Right now there just aren't enough levels for this to be fun after a couple hours.  

What i think would do wonders for the game is a community level-builder/community servers. Until then I'm gonna refund but I wish the game luck.",False

"A great game to play with friends with a lot of free content the shows have many fun game modes categorised : Team, strategy, race and logic! I would highly recommend this game to everyone looking for a bit of fun during COVID-19.",True
"Aside from the technical issues at launch, the game isn't terrible but I just don't really enjoy it.  There is no single player, no practice, no way to choose what events to do or even what types, it's a single ""play"" button to enter a multiplayer queue for some random event.  It's all the luck of a Battle Royale game with often very little skill involved in some of the events.  Some people will like that, to me it often felt shallow and annoying.  Plus you spend half your time looking at menus or countdowns and not actually playing.  It feels like a free to play game, with the microtransactions already in place, and I would bet in a few months when the audience is dead it will become one.",False
"i know it says i have 170 hours but that is because i played the crap out of this game when it launched. Over those many hours i have realized most of the flaws in this game. 

tl:dr- this game is worth if you play for about 5 hours total, once you go over 5 hours or get your 1st win you will start to see the flaws with this game and only feel like every time you lose it's because of some bs. And the Cheaters run this game

1. the latency in this game is terrible- it makes modes idk, EVERY SINGLE TAIL MODE awful, because u can get your tail stolen from a mile away and yet you can literally BE HOLDING ONTO SOMEONE and the tail wont get stolen, same for the jinxed mode.

2. the grabbing mechanic- what ends up happening is someone will grab you and push you like you are a little child, while when you grab someone and try to push or pull them it's like trying to move a concrete cylinder. You can jump when you are being grabbed to break out of a grab but that isnt useful when you are on an edge and jumping isnt useful then. 

3. The finales are terrible ways to choose a winner- We will start with fall mountain, there isnt much to say about this besides if you get a back spawn OR if you get touched by literally anything, you will fall and because it's you vs usually 9 other people, so falling is basically a loss. And i mean anything, that's another issue with this game, the amount of times you will be grazed by something and fall over like a new born giraffe, but then see someone get hit by something harder than the power of standing at the end of a shotgun being shot, and they just get a broken back and keep walking like it didnt even happen. Ok let's move on. Hexagon, i used to think hexagon was the best because i thought it required the most amount of skill but that's only true if you are up against 4 year olds, which tbh most of the times it feels like you are. There are 2 main issues with hexagon, the first being clipping through floors, while you could be an amazing run, that doesnt matter when once you finally fall down a floor you dont actually land on the floor below you, you clip through the floor and fall more floors than you were supposed too. The other issue with hexagon is, youre not going to believe this, but latency, WOW GIVE IT UP FOR LATENCY EVERYONE WOOOOO, but really, just like how the grabbing is, you can have someone running behind you on the tiles you already ran on and they could be disappearing as you are running over them, and they will just trail behind you as if the tiles were still there, hmm i wonder why. ""latency, that's why"" Ok enough about hexagon. Jump Showdown. The ""newest"" finale. It isnt really the newest, it was in the beta and got removed for some unknown reason, then readded later after like a week of full release. There is only really one issue with this mode, whenever you would stand in the middle of 2 platforms it would some times not register that you jumped, so you would end up getting hit by the bar and it'd cause you to lose. The last finale mode i wont go into much detail about, it's called Royale Fumble, it's a tail mode, be the last to hold the tail. I already talked about tails so you can guess why this mode is trash. In case you dont remember, ""latency"" And those are all the issues ive encountered with the finales, im sure there are more i missed since this game i a clutter mess, just like this review but we will move on for now.

4. Cheaters/Hackers- Cheaters ruin this game, out of the hundreds of matches ive played ive managed to beat 1 hacker. Most of the time when i get against a cheater ill see what kind of cheat they are using and determine if it's even worth stay or not. Some hackers have a speed hack which lets them run at the speed of light. This usually results in them qualifying instantly, they then get to watch everyone else play for the entire round, SOUNDS LIKE FUN IF YOU ASK ME. Another cheat that ive seen a lot is this cheat that let's you jump super high into the air, like ""into space high"", so on finales like hexagon or jump showdown they jump up, everyone falls, they stay in the air and win. Im not sure why there isnt a killbox if you go as high as they do.  This is also the cheat that i beat, it was on jump showdown and i guess they didnt set there jump high enough so they ended up falling back down and didnt land on a platform and got eliminated. The main issue with cheaters is there isnt a report feature. There just isnt a report feature. The closest thing there was to a report feature was on the fall guys discord, but they closed it for some reason. Probably closed it because they got rid of names because of a bug, and gave everyone a generic 0001-9999 number, so multiple people have the same number so you cant report someone based off there number, so the only way they get banned is based of the anti cheat detecting them. So there is never any type of satisfaction when you vs a cheater, like ""hey at least i reported them"" nope, once you vs a cheater you might as well leave the game.

5. Win 5 games in a row- This is a stupid achievement. I managed to achieve it early on before everyone knew somewhat of wtf was going on. But it's already hard to win 1 game because of how inconsistent the team modes are, the finales, the latency, and the cheaters. But they want you to do it 5 times IN A ROW. This is just stupid. 

We gonna finish this basic.
IN CONCLUSION, 
if you only intend on playing this game for like 5 hours, then get it.
if you intend on playing this game for more than 5 hours, then dont get it.


also there are dc's nonstop and the servers are constantly down : )",False
Unplayable game right now. Fix the servers and then we'll see about a positive review bombing,False
"Tons of cheaters and unable to report them. Very repetitive, same courses over and over. There is a lot of potential for this to be fun but right now it is falling way short. Gets old super quick. Definitly not worth the price point it is at.",False
"While the core game is fun the execution is pretty poor. Almost a month in and there is still server issues so the 5 or so games that rely heavily on the grab mechanic are a toss up at best and frustrating at worst.  In an hour you'll probably run into about 4 hackers who make the game unwinable. This game has many ways to discourage the player from playing it again because of these issues. Patches are on the way but a lot of the simple quality of life things are still missing (instant spectate on your party, custom names, the pineapple having only one team color, etc.) Devs say they want to address these issues, but with the resources that they now have due to the game's success, most of this should have already been addressed. I'm skeptical they will ever get to it because a lot of the community will jump to the, ""they're just an indie studio,"" defense. Its an excuse for persistant problems that make the game actively worse. 

So to sum it up, fun at its core that is mired by little problems that will leave a player frustrated once the wackyness wares off.",False
i did really enjoy the game but it is just full of hacks every game has at least 1 hacker that will ruin it,False
"Fun enough to get me past the 2 hour refund window but hackers wins most matches, so its thumbs down.",False
too many cheating.....,False
"I tried very hard to like this game. I've played on my own or with friends and all in all its just frustrating. As a battle royale its cute but that's the only thing it has going for it at this point. Constant disconnections, getting kicked from games, getting kicked before even starting a match when it takes 5 minutes to get enough players, speed hackers, getting the exact same few maps over and over again, the team games aren't fun or fair most of the time, getting stuck spectating for ages just because you didn't leave at just the right time, getting stuck in weird camera angles and the game just freezing after getting eliminated, and inconsistent controls are just a few of the problems I've noticed in my few hours of play. It's also very difficult to enjoy the rounds when there are clearly hackers that you now can't see the name of and hope to find the fall guy number to report them. It just feels like an incomplete game and I don't know if I'd ever come back to playing it.",False
"This game is stupid fun!!! Even more fun with friends!
Great game at launch, can't wait to see what they introduce in future updates.
Maybe some community-made mini-games, or puzzles with greater difficulty, or games for smaller groups
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",True
"[b]NO LONGER RUNS ON LINUX[/b]
The developers recently updated the game to use easy anticheat, which broke compatibility with proton. This was done with no warning or remediation for linux players.

EDIT: Requests for refunds by linux players are also being refused by steam.",False
"Mid-season update made this game a lot less fun. Supposedly they 'improved' the physics, but to me they just made the netcode suck more. I fall over for no reason all the time now, and I assume because of other players bumping into me on their screen but not mine. The jump showdown games the jump button doesn't work sometimes, seemingly completely at random, and I still don't know why.

I could still weather all that if it weren't for forced team and BS RNG stages being the reason you lose 80% of the time.

If they give Solo Queue an option to opt-out of team games, I will recommend this. Until then only play it if you can handle terrible netcode and losing to that or a coin toss game almost every time you lose. If you really DGAF about winning, and don't get frustrated at such BS, then there's still a lot of fun to be had.",False
completely unplayable. stuck on looking for players for several hours. The only thing I can do is to request a refund,False
"Great game, unfortunately this game does not choose to cater to all and instead chooses to continue to rope people into the big tech monopoly pig pen. Bought the game and it was working until the anti-cheat update came out. Now you can't start a game on Linux. LINUX USERS BEWARE. It won't work despite it having worked. Steam won't refund you either. People will tell you ""oh well they never said they supported the game on Linux anyways"" but it literally ran on Linux for weeks. The update THEY chose to implement was decisively anti-Linux.",False
"It's fun, especially with friends. But that enjoyment doesn't last at all

But after some hours it will get repetitive, boring and easy. There are like 15 game modes, some of them very alike, it feels like the developers are running out of ideas which is odd since they could just use game modes from funny similar games.

Now, the hacker problem. Get a fugging anti-cheat system in place! A week ago there was no anti-cheat like at all. Now there is Easy Anti-cheat in place which is hot garbage but hopefully it will keep dumbáss hackers out.

The reasons you get eliminated are either: Bad/AFK teammates in team modes or fail on the last round due to some hacker activating his cheats on the last round to bypass anti-cheat.

There are some golden moments though, like when you and your friends get very far into the game since the funnier game modes are later on in the game after 2-3 rounds, you might pick the right door 3 times in a row in Door Dash, the item you've been wanting for some time now finally returns in the shop or maybe you actually win for once. If you win a game, congratulations -- you are  in one of the lobbies that didn't have a hacker in it, that's very rare!

The reasons you get eliminated are either: Bad/AFK teammates in team modes or fail on the final round due to being dogpiled or disconnected due to servers. 

I feel like the only way the developers can save this game is making Season 2 a breakthrough and more fresh n original. I really hope the developers can make something truly unique and fun, mostly because I spent 20€ on this and don't want it to go to nothing...

Don't buy this, maybe later. It just feels rushed to get released at the start of August so it can get peoples attention away from the bigger (and better) games releasing near the end of the month like Horizon, Microsoft Flight Sim, Risk of Rain 2",False

"Certain teams are literally coded to be at a disadvantage when there's not enough players to make the teams properly even or when groups/parties lose their buddies, there's actually very few different minigames, with some of them being given extra priority and clones. (Looking at f*ckin tailtag.. why are there three variants of what is arguably one of the worst minigames?)

The team games just feel out of place, this is a game that's supposed to be like Takeshi's Castle, or Wipeout but with crowds of beans with randomised physics instead of solo runners. Takeshi's Castle had next to no team games, whereas half of the minigames in Fall Guys are team-based, and a good chunk of which are seriously unfun due to players that purposely throw matches and the aforementioned balancing issues when there's an indivisible number for that team game.

For $20-$30, the hitboxes and sync needs to be much better, and with how simple and how many assets there already are, there really should be more unique minigames, or at least a bunch more obstacle courses than we have. I will amend this part depending on whether there's a good dump of non-costume related content with Season 2, but for now, there's a severe lack of unique non-team games besides the obstacle courses.

As mentioned earlier, the physics are pretty much random, and somehow a guy that's on the ground flailing about can push better than somebody who's running along just fine, meaning if a guy falls in front of you, there's a good chance he will either bump you ridiculously hard somehow and send you flying back/to the side, bring you to a dead stop, or trip you as well, when you *should* be able to just kick his sorry butt out of the way.

To top it off, the controls are pretty unresponsive thanks to the sh*tty sync, so expect to have to spam things like grab or dive to actually do them.

All in all.. wait for it to be on sale for at least 30% until they address the content and sync issues. Seriously, it's been a month and this games servers are about as stable as Diablo 3's on launch day... f*ckin riddy m8.",False

"[I'm writing this review out of love and passion for this game. This review is not meant as a flame or harassment towards the developers & any other parties involved]

I love playing this game. I love the idea, the cartoon style, etc. Even after this review, I'll keep playing this game because I love it and I feel like I have the skill to compete with the latest meta of the game to keep winning crowns.

This game is casual to the outsider's eye. It gives off a casual feel. However, this game IS competitive whether you see it that way or not. You are competing for a crown, therefore it is highly discouraging when something happens that um... should not.

This game has SERIOUS problems such as the horrible server net code, paired with some mini games that rely on such bad net code, the constant server outages OUTSIDE of maintenance, and the map decisions are just... not right. This game feels like it was rushed when there's no reason for it to be rushed.

On my screen, I will be doing something COMPLETELY different to what someone else sees on their screen. The server will try to correct it the best way it can, but it can be more disastrous than helpful (especially with how unbelievably the rag dolling effects are. I know what they're trying to do with it but... really? Tone it down a bit. The insane rag dolling just helps make the overall experience even worse when paired with the horrible server net code). This is how the long tail grabs happen on Tail Tag, Team Tail Tag, and Royal Fumble. Those are just specific map wise, this just happens throughout the entire game which is... just not good relying on horrible net code to be on your side for a win.

Speaking of Royal Fumble, it is NOT good having this as a final match for the crown. One player is given a tail and will win if they keep said tail. Pair this with the horrible net code mentioned before, the long grabbing arms because of net code, the really exaggerated rag dolling effects, AND the obstacles in the map... its arguably EASIER to keep the tail rather than getting it from the tailed player.

The game has gotten some good updates, especially the EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) update (Why did this take so long to happen? ""We didn't expect much players to get into this game!"" is NOT a good excuse for having terrible performance issues. Have faith in your game and go all out. Not expecting a big player base is a very lackluster, and unacceptable excuse to not be prepared for the very best. Again, have faith in your product or don't even release it to begin with, especially when its a form of entertainment). However... with every update, it feels like something different feels off or breaks... why is this? Please properly test updates before making them public. This game is so all over the place, and I feel that this kind of process is disastrous for any other game (High stuff like Mario Bros, Smash Bros, CoD, Halo, etc.) to have. Their fanbases would be going through the roof. Don't get me started on the infamous ""stutter jump"" bug on Jump Showdown, or the ""Grabbing crown but no win"" bug on Fall Mountain. I've seen countless complaints of this and has yet to be addressed/patched... since release. 

Please take the development of this game more seriously. I hope to see vast improvements in Season 2, or I guess I'm unfortunately calling it quits. If you have the patience for stuff like this, go for it, but I am leaving this as a negative review as the game is in such a poor state and fails to address issues all at once without creating a new bug in the process (poor update testing).",False

"O jogo é muito bom, porém frustrante devido aos servidores. Todos os dias que jogo, caio do sevidor múltiplas vezes, ou passo um bom tempo sem nem conseguir entrar em uma partida, porque sou tirado enquanto o lobby tá sendo preenchido.

Múktiplas vezes fui tirado de uma final por cause de problemas de servidor, e sempre que isso acontece, o jogador não recebe nenhum dos pontos que teria ganhado naquela partida. Devido a isso, desisti de alcançar o level máximo da temporada, por constantemente deixar de ganhar pontos que deveria ter ganho.",True

"I would play this game more if they made some of the game modes less random and less based on other players (not including team games). I understand that the game is designed to be silly and random but when your in a giant crowd being tossed around it really becomes infuriating. I would be interested to see a queue-up mode where for certain game modes collisions with other players could be turned off to raise the skill ceiling, though I do once again understand this would somewhat contradict the game's philosophy. Another problem I have with this game is the queuing system. I find that most of the time i cant seem to get into a match at all and am left waiting only to be rewarded with a screen saying I have been disconnected for the queue. Overall, I would say that if you enjoy silly, crazy and somewhat chaotic game play and you are willing to wait in the queue, then this game is for you. But if you are looking for a game to sweat out and climb the ladder, then i personally wouldn't recommend this. This game has a lot of potential, and i'm looking forward to see what season 2 has to offer.",False

"Fall guys is a great and hilarious game with an incredibly frustrating but sometimes rewarding physics engine that sometimes can decide the outcome of a game solely based on rng and luck. 

I do however feel like the devs are torn on whether or not the game should be more rng heavy to discourage people from following the exact same path on each map every game or if it should be more of a higher skill ceiling to encourage the efficiency we see people trying to push.

 I would like some maps to be just a pure stupid rng fiesta for fun and some to actually take some map knowledge and maybe some tricky parkour to pass.

Other than that, it's a great game that i really hope stays around for long.

"Even before the era where hackers were so abundant in the game, I still enjoyed playing even though almost every 1 and 3 games were ruined by a hacker. I still enjoyed playing because it's always fun to see who can make it to the end. This game is a very exhilarating game and never gets boring, even if the servers take a while to join I am still proud of the developers for holding this many people on one platform with servers that match the country or region you are from. 

Now that they impletemented the easy anti-cheat system I have not found any cheaters recently and the game has been flawless. They made updates recently (at the time of this review) that allow the maps to have different obstacles so that the maps are not just the same for people who have played the game a lot. 

The battle pass is free and you get items based on the amount of games you play, without having to pay initially. There are optional packs that you can buy to get a headstart on the costumes that are there for your courtesy but 100% not required. 

The achievements in this game are also great and well thought out, some of them are challenging and reward people who have played for a while but none of them seem impossible to get or too easy to get.

This game also offers really nice controller support. I will admit I had to look it up beforehand because there are settings you have to turn on, but I was very surprised to see how well it was compatible with my Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. All I had to do was turn on a setting which this video explained very helpfully: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TarDE_oaBy4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TarDE_oaBy [/url]

Overall this game is fun and addicting to watch, but also addicting to play as well and for its price I would reccomend getting it through a sale if they ever have one, but it is also quite worth the $20 purchase as well if you have some money lying around or some time to commit to a game. I really am excited to see the future of this game now that the hackers have been dealt with a little bit more. 10/10 :)",True

Really good graphics. It isn't trying to be realistic, just cartoony, so in that department, this game excels in.

Costumes are fun
Cons:
Quite a few game modes are bad
- Tail Tag [I love it, many others hate it, so i'm putting it here] Basically, some players have tails, some don't. You need a tail at the end of the round, or else you are eliminated
- SeeSaw. If you think ANYONE here has some knowledge of gravity, you would be wrong.
- Team Games: Essentially makes it so everyone has the lowest IQ physically imaginable, and you are stuck with people who don't know how to jump
- Team Tail Tag. The badness [Well, not to me] of Tail Tag, but with the things Team games provide.
- Fruit Chute. [Not sure how people feel about this] Essentially, you are super slow, climbing up a mountain and cannons, loaded with fruit, CHUTE [haha funni] you down.

"  This game is a blast with friends. A few changes that should be made is 1. Let us create are own names. 2. If in a group and you don't make it to next to next round then focus on one of your friends in your group. 3 it sucks to watch the next round only for the purpose to follow the progress of your friend and you are given a random guy. We constantly have to say what number we are so we can scroll through a bunch of guys with numbers. One round my friend who was 1392 and I only kept track of that number because 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue, I clicked through a dozen different toons and found him. I said ""damn you changed your outfit. your making it hard to track you."" he said he didn't change. I clicked a couple more times and yes there was two 1392s in that round. Last thing is stop the hackers. Don't know what compels anyone to cheat but especially a game that is as easy going as this. If you cheat at this game then you have serious problems. Don't ask your parents for a dog or cat. You don't deserve a goldfish. You can't cheat a pet on food. Boo",True

Liked - Gameplay is super fun! Easy to pick up / characters + costumes are adorable. Excellent value for the purchase price. In game currency to acquire new outfits & dances accumulates quickly which always seems to be the crux of many games trying to force additional in game purchases. Dislike - I came across at least a dozen games where cheaters were just floating in the air or leaping straight to the finish line. That being said the most recent update appears to have eliminated that problem and since then i havent seen any cheaters or hackers! Super biased opinion - Part of me wishes that the team games didnt exist or werent considered past the 3rd round.,True

"This game is a lot of fun for the most part, but it has some draw backs. Once players worked out they can grab and through some finger gymnastics shove people this game is now filling up with lowly playgound bullies. One particular level *Slime Climb* Is a prime exaple of this as at one of the choke points you almost always find one player shoving and preventing people from progressing, which causes the games to often progress to the final crown level. As there is no easy in game way to report players for bad sportsman ship, this kind of toxic behaviour really leaves a bad after taste, which is a shame.

This game is pure luck unless you cheat your way to victory, despite attempting my absolute hardest to parkour my way to victory, I still loose the first or even second round without fail, even with different players.

"I've played this game for a fair amount of hours, won a lot of games and decided to give it a negative review. Sure, it's ""fun"", but only if you play with friends, most of the time when you play alone it's all about RNG and probably facing other groups of friends. If that's not the problem then it is the terrible de-sync this game faces; you'll be in front of the crown in Fall mountain and yet the game decides it's not fair and you never actually grabbed the crown.

Hackers were a midly inconvenience in comparison with connection problems. I like the game but i feel like every time they try to ""fix"" it, they just wreck it even further.

2. Implemented generic usernames as quick hack to solve people abusing easy to fix HTML exploit
3. Did nothing to resolve hacker problem for weeks and lied to players about identifying hackers on 'first instance'

"The game itself is really fun. Lot's of cosmetics to unlock and it feels really rewarding winning a crown.
The games crossover with other major game titles are fun and it's nice to just play this game with a group of friends.  
However, I will not be recommending this game for a very simple reason. Something that's making this game literally unplayable for PC users. The hackers, this game is riddled with cheaters that just instantly fly through the map and qualifies in less than 3 seconds. It's impossible right now to find one match where there is no hackers. At first it didn't bother me that much but then it just kept getting worse and worse. Match after match, more and more of them. I am starting to lose faith in this game, and if they don't fix this soon the game will die. I feel like they don't even have a anti-cheat system in place at times. 
I will change my review to positive once they deal with all the hackers, but until then I do not recommend this game.",False

Would highly recommend this game to any and all age groups. If you get Fall Ball as a stage then just ragequit.,True
WAY too many hackers. Literally started playing again after awhile and two hackers back to back. DO NOT GET THIS until they implement some actual reporting system or have some kind of hacker detector. Even Minecraft servers have flying detection so I don't see why this game can't have it.,False

Apart from this it's a pretty good game. Love it.",True

the funniest game ever,True
"This game was innovative , simplistic yet complex, and an all around fresh addition. However with the surge in popularity came the surge in hackers. Currently the game has no report system and there has been little to no attempt on containing the influx of hackers. The game's simplistic mechanics of working your way through obstacles becomes game breaking when hackers are using ""fly hacks"" to bypass them. The game in its current format with no way to handle hackers makes it absolutely unplayable as hackers fly right past everyone to win ever single match. Until a system to handle hackers is implemented, I would not recommended the game.",False
"Only played about 3 hours of this game as of writing this, and so far the game is a lot of fun, there are issues tho that need to be addressed and I'm sure others have addressed these issues as well, firstly, the cheaters, I haven't encountered many so far, but there are cheaters in this game, making it almost if not impossible for them to lose at all, the devs really need to find a way to ban these cheaters, secondly (this one is minor), when I go into a match, my mouse cursor is still on screen, even during gameplay, so as I'm playing, I see my cursor flying all over my screen as I move my camera, and thirdly, the biggest issue I have, is the servers, I have gotten so many server error messages that either kick me from searching for a game, or even when I'm in the middle of a game, just a random message saying ""there is a server error"" kicking me out to the main menu.

If the devs could fix these 3 main issues, the game would be perfect! would I recommend this game? Yes! So long as you keep in mind the bugs/server error messages, the cheaters, and possibly a cursor that won't go away during gameplay.

If there are other issues, I haven't encountered them yet, overall, I would give Fall Guys a 7/10.",True

"Overall, Fall Guys is a pretty enjoyable experience in small periods of gameplay. It is certainly not one of those games that you could play for several hours in a row; it would get really repetitive. Fall Guys is best played with friends and other people, but it can be alright playing solos for about an hour or so. Honestly, the $20 price tag is a little steep for the amount of content that's in the game at the moment. 

After having played for 20 hours, the minigames are starting to become a little bit monotonous. Apparently, they are going to be adding new ones in the next season, which is about 20 days away. I will admit that I am impressed at how few server issues I have experienced considering the fact that the developers of this game never anticipated it to become as popular as it did so quickly. 

Overall, I would recommend it, but it would be best to wait until Season 2 if you do not want things becoming repetitive.",True

Coming back now I decided to purchase the game again in hopes that with the ""server maintenance"" that the developers claim to have implemented the game would be fixed.

Turns out even after the ""maintenance"" this error still persists and prevents myself from being able to enjoy the overpriced game I had just purchased. I have already submitted a ticket to have this resolved but I know that it will be very difficult to receive my money back since I have already requested a refund on this game before along with having spent over 2 hours solely on attempting to launch the game.

- Hackers. There's just way too many. I can't win a game when there's a hacker in my lobby floating above everyone else having to actually play the game correctly and then eventually being knocked off in the last round.

- Buggy af game servers. I constantly am being kicked out of games, and being either kicked out of my group with friends or being split up with them (i.e they'll be put in a game and I won't, or vice versa after queueing for the same lobby together).

"When i first saw the game, I thought ""Wow, its impressive that they handle these physics in a multiplayer setting"" but then I realized they dont, things are handled clientside, making cheating super easy and rampant. Game is pretty unplayable, since each match has at least 3-4 cheaters now, being able to eliminate all other players within the first two rounds... This needs to be fixed before the game can be enjoyed.",False
e,True
"With only three buttons – jump, dive and grab – it’s easy to pick up a joypad and join in. Much of the action is anarchy, but tactics do emerge. On one challenge, players have to run through a series of doors, but some doors are fake and won’t open, so it is wise to lurk just behind the pack leaders to find an uncontested route. On another circuit, competitors have to work out safe passage across a tiled floor where some tiles disappear, sending victims tumbling back to the beginning. Unfortunately, the only way to test if a tile is safe is to stand on it, so players must attempt to push each other forward to take the hit. In future years, academics studying the psychology of crowds will have a field day with this data.

The game takes place in a DayGlo-style cartoon world. Everything is bright pink, bright yellow or bright red; everything is shiny and large and padded. It’s as if an athletics tournament was brainstormed by Teletubbies. The characters look like supermarket own-brand versions of Minions, and players can unlock new outfits and accessories through playing or paying. You don’t have to dress as a pineapple in a tie-dyed tutu, but why not?

Fall Guys is raucous, ridiculous fun. Some players will be reminded of 1970s family gameshow It’s a Knockout, while others will see a resemblance to Takeshi’s Castle: both involved the ritual humiliation of participants through zany tasks and both featured a compelling mix of knockabout comedy and sociopathic competitiveness. Fall Guys is the perfect heir to those legacies for the broadband generation, a game made for Twitch and YouTube streaming.

Amid the chaos, perhaps what it lacks are intriguing variables. After two years, Fortnite still has 300 million players because the landscapes are fascinating to explore and every encounter with rival players is different. Fall Guys has lots of obstacle courses and no doubt more will be added in subsequent seasons, but the strategic possibilities are comparatively narrow, so your enthusiasm and amusement may not last long. You can only play it online, not with friends in the same room – so the potential of Fall Guys as a party game is lost. (Although the developer has hinted that a local multiplayer mode may be added.)

Still, this is an unmissable, sugary treat, bursting with kaleidoscopic entertainment, and is available for £15.99 on Steam and free via PlayStation Plus. It’s a perfect entry point to battle royale games for those who are intrigued by their structure but put off by their violent undertones. And even though you can’t play against your family, you can all gather around the TV and enjoy the hilarity of 60 bean-shaped critters trying to simultaneously cram themselves through a narrow doorway, or across a rotating platform. It is lovely to see a game like this – so aware of its own silliness and so aware that it is exactly what we need right now.",True
"This review is made on Sept 12, 2020. 

The game concept and execution of the actual game play is gold. But, the lack of experience of the development team in making an online multiplayer clearly shows in the final product: 1. The developers decision to have the game reports your location to the server (instead of your button input and replying back your supposed position) makes it very easy for people to cheat and that breaks non-cheaters' gaming experience. 2. Queuing for a game takes several minutes and you can't do anything except watching your Fall Guy falls. They should have let the players go into a spawn lobby while waiting for other players, that way at least we can mess around rather than being bored. 3. After you loss a round, the default next step by the game is to spectate a random opponent. Nobody in the world would like to do this. They should have made returning to lobby the default and spectating opponents optional, unless you play with a friend, then the game should spectate that friend automatically. 4. Why don't they just use Steam ID as the character names instead of random Fall Guy #1234?! That should be the most basic thing to do in a multiplayer game. 5. Many other small but annoying things. This game has BIG potential but in desperate need of an overhaul.",True

Also, we can't report the cheaters because we can't identify them. They don't have a unique ID

I just love this game.,True
"I have enjoyed the game since the beginning. I did not grew up as a gamer, so playing this in my adult life is fun. I don't have high expectations of myself to win, so I enjoy grinding the rounds repeatedly. I can now qualify in the final rounds and have a fighting chance. The quirky music, art style, and the concept of a game show combined got me.

I enjoy the game and I still play it after a long day.  I am nearing level 30. I love playing it. Even if I have never won a crown. 

Although, multiple times I had been the last guy to fall against a gamer. If there were no cheaters, I know I have won some crowns of my own.

I have been playing this game for a couple of weeks and I am seeing people spiral down into chaos. Now that there are more familiar players, there are more bullies. Worse, there are cheaters who are bullies too. They push off players while they whoosh through the air and spoil the experience for the rest of the players.

The game was very welcoming to inexperienced players like me. So, I want this game to survive. I hope the developers come up with something to make the cheater guys finally fall. Until then, clean players like us would have to be satisfied with losing to cheaters repeatedly.",True

After one month, there is no new content, no new levels, just some costumes which, in my opinion, are getting uglier and uglier.

The game itself is very fun, it's cute, it has modest system requirements. It works moderately well on Linux with Proton (works, but gets disconnected more often). Not every mini game is perfect and lag is worse than it needs to be, but fundamentally, the game is fun. 

But the game is completely overrun with cheaters. It's gotten to the point where you basically can't win because someone in the game is all but guaranteed to be cheating. The excitement of the final round is no longer ""will I manage to win"" but simply ""will the game be won by one cheater, or will it be a stalemate between multiple cheaters?""

If the devs can ever get a handle on the cheating there will once again be a reason to play.",False

"It’s like Wipeout meets a Battle Royale game. Super fun, especially when you are playing with friends as you hilariously rag doll and get into intense situations. However, this game needs to be fixed, there has been moments in the team games, (which I hate), where someone would just grab you from an unreachable distance, making it frustrating and annoying when you are so close to getting qualified. The presentation also needs work, it doesn’t feel like you are on a crash course TV show, it kinda just feels like a death march and the last character to get to the end game survives. Some of the levels suck, too. Team based levels will always suck because you could be an amazing player during these rounds and your teammates could just be god awful and troll as well. Hackers roam freely as well so you might as well quit when you encounter them. 
A lot of problems plague Fall Guys, but it’s honestly a decent game, it’s just rough around the edges. I love the customization and simple gameplay. Give it a shot if you are looking for a fun multiplayer game that you can just turn your brain off to. 7/10.",True

"I wish that you could give like halfway rating. The game itself is just perfect. If I could just play the game at it's core, it would be so fun, but I didn't have a Playstation so I bought it for PC.

As a PC user, I've played about 43 hours or so at this point and it was wonderful my first few days. I rarely saw hackers or people trying to mess with it because who would? It's a game about cute little beans and it's a fun platformer that gives a silly crown reward. But after around 3 days I seemed to only ever be stuck in matches where a hacking player would only hack during the last round or the last two rounds.

I've been grabbed by people and thrown off the map due to the grab hack. I've been the last actual player in hex multiple times , but lost due to the fact that one or two people will be just bouncing around on the first level, I lose. I've been at fall mountain where people the second the game starts and the first row has made it out of the starting line, we've already lost because a player just warped directly to the crown in roughly 3 seconds.

It took all enjoyment out of the game. I still keep trying it every now and then, because it is fun with no hackers, to see if I get connected to a server with not a lot of hackers, but I generally only get a few real games out of it. And I wouldn't care if I had played almost 50 hours of a game and hadn't won, if there were no hackers. That's part of the appeal. That's actually kind of the whole appeal of a cutesy MMO platformer, to get better and win based on skill. But it just isn't it.

At this moment, for PC players, I could not recommend buying this game. It would be a waste of money if you are wanting an addicting game with the occasional high of winning a round and the frustration of not winning. But to know that the only way to win is to out-hack the hackers that the company itself tells you not to report and gives you no way to actually report, it's pointless. 

Make players have unique IDs that cannot be changed, so they can be reported. I can't report player ""229"" because there are probably tons of that number player across the multiple servers. Have people who try to regulate and bounce between the countless servers.

Do something that makes the game worth paying for. No one cares about the upcoming second season. People just want to play. But it is made into a game that is free on a platform that is fairly hard to hack, yet costs real money on the platform where people can do anything at all. At this point, with the amount of hackers I've played with, it just feels like they are following in the GTA path, yet somehow, inexplicably, handling it worse that even Rockstar.",False

"This game is alright for the shits and gigs, it is at least fun to play with friends. I was expecting a bit more from this game I suppose, I don't quite know what that something was but I was hoping there would be some kind of fun flare to it. There was at the start, at least. It's colourful, shiny, and bright. That's kind of it though... You get the same levels over and over, I hardly ever got to experience other levels unless I was out and it was the upcoming level shown. 
Perhaps more will come with later updates, lets hope.

All I will say is wait for a sale, it is not worth full price in my opinion. Play it with friends as well, it is very much a pain to play solo. Also you will have no chance winning against a hacker unfortunately. That particularly turned me off the game, but overall it was surprisingly a bland game in general. Again though they might add more, so I will at least be looking out for that.
Probably still going to play it with friends every now and then though.",False

"The general concept is great, and there's fun to be had. The visuals are charming and the music is fine.

Because it's based on physics and you're dealing with as many as 60 players (who can collide with each other), the gameplay is very sloppy, both in practice and in the way it's programmed. That should be part of the fun, but it's a purely competitive game with the only goal being winning, and so much of what happens is random that it feels like a waste of time to be invested in it.

Minigames are all simple and fun in terms of objectives (dodge, jump, memory, etc) but could have more variety. After a few hours, I realized just how little this game has to offer.

One more thing worth mentioning is that there's no way to interact with other players in the game, aside from playing a little animation. Names are just 4 digit codes, no way to join random people, and no chat (text, or voice). Ultimately not a very social experience for a 60 player game.

I have a good internet connection speed, but if you don't, DEFINITELY don't get this game, the slightest bit of lag will ruin a match in seconds.

Lastly, and (currently) most importantly, there are so many people hacking the game to cheat that it's barely worth playing. During a 2 hour play session, about 40% of my matches had at least one cheater; it's absolutely rampant.

So yea, I don't really recommend it at the moment despite a lot of what it does well. Doesn't really offer enough for the price tag in my opinion, and cheaters have basically taken over the game for the moment.",False

Edit: No more cheaters/hackers!

HOWEVER, everyday I play this game I randomly get kicked out to Windows with the message:

Easy Anti-Cheat
Game Security Violation Detected (#00000001)

I heard updating Windows 10 would fix this, which I did (which caused separate new problems), and it didn't even fix this issue. Wish they'd come up with a fix for this.",False
"This is the blueprint for an exceptional game, the framework for easily the most unique and fun battle royale to date. That's it though. Nothing beyond that. Although displaying insane amounts of promise, this game is absolutely riddled with issues that make it almost impossible to recommend. 

First and foremost, hackers. Who the fuck would bother dumping their precious time and money into a competitive multiplayer game knowing that 50% of their games would be literally unwinnable? Unless you're clinically insane or enjoy LoL (there's no difference), it's blatantly obvious that nobody would do this. An impressive player base has hit this game starting out, but at the rate I see hackers in my games, I expect 90% of players to get out and get out quick before they have to see another flying hotdog scale a 500 foot tall mountain in 15 seconds flat. The developers seem nice enough, certainly better than big EA and Activision, but they also seem to have become rather arrogant in the face of a massively successful launch. Frequent player base communications and an admittedly amusing but still disingenuous Twitter account is far from enough to appease fed up fans; action needs to be taken. They say that hackers will be banned within their first few matches, but, last I checked, amassing 10+ crowns takes a bit longer than a few games. Point is, the current state of hackers is abysmal and reason enough to not come anywhere near this game. 

Now onto a more fundamental aspect of the game, the different modes. Fall Guys is at its best when it gives you a challenging obstacle course that rewards timing, quick thinking, and flawless execution. Whirlygig, Hit Parade, Slime Climb, Dizzy Heights and, best of all, Fall Mountain are the stages in which the promise in this game lies. Too bad you can't get them all the time. Enter just about every team game. This goes for most games in general, but getting forced to play with randoms is awful, game ruiningly awful. No matter your skill level, no matter your performance up until that point, team games throw all of that to the wind. No, this is not ""casual"" game design, this is just bad game design. Battle royales are designed to be won through skill, competitive games are designed to be won through skill. RNG is the antithesis of skill. There's a reason people laugh in the face of Fortnite esports and the idea of battle royale esports in general. The difference in those games, however, is that you can minimize RNG by playing solos, wherein you can compensate for the RNG aspect of the game that is inherent to the medium with pure skill. That doesn't work here. There is no true solo mode. You are at the mercy of the game, potentially killing it round after round on the aforementioned obstacle course style stages, only to be thrown into a round of Fall Ball with uneven teams and brain dead teammates to boot. No amount of skill can compensate for this aspect of the game, which is, as I mentioned, unavoidable. 

Beyond these team games which accomplish nothing but frustration and unbalance, the game also has its fair share of downright boring and unengaging modes. They aren't hard per se, just poorly designed. Tip Toe, Perfect Match, Roll Out, these are a drag to play and wreck the momentum that tends to build up across rounds. So, to sum it up, every mode besides Hex-A-Gone, Block Party, and the obstacle courses kind of suck. Top it off with virtually no reason to actually play in a squad, nonexistent quality of life features, and a host of bugs, and, as I said in the beginning, I just can't recommend this game in good conscience. 

And yet, I return, day after day, to deal with all of the issues I just bothered to describe. Maybe it's a testament to just how much potential this game has, or maybe I'm just turning into a LoL player, who knows, but regardless, do not buy this game. Don't buy into the hype, don't buy into the bright colors and unique style, just don't buy it........ until, of course, they fix all of these issues in god knows how long, in which case, buy away.",False

"It's a decent game. The selection of minigames isn't too massive, but they are adding more in upcoming seasons. This is a pretty good game to sit down and relax over with a couple of friends. There are a few issues however; firstly, hackers have taken note of this game, so you can find them in every few games. Some run faster than everyone else, some can see the hidden path in one of the minigames, and some can fly. I was playing on the memory game and someone who was flying grabbed me and flew to the edge, dropping me down. Also, some skins don't have appropriate team colors. The full pineapple skin, for instance, turns white and pink no matter which team you're on, if I'm not mistaken, so if you were playing Jinx, you would have to grab every pineapple you see because you wouldn't know if they were friendly or not.",True

You get great results for 5 rounds. The Final: A jackass dickhead motherfucker with one of the most expensive outfits in the game that was released WEEKS ago flies through the air, grabs the crown and shows you his celebration (released 2 weeks ago; price: 5 crowns). He is the fucker with the most gear you've ever seen, he's probably flagged by the system for going 50000 miles an hour and flying for 50 seconds but the employee responsible for banning him works at the entrance to a parking garage where everything smells like piss, because, unattentive fucker that he is, he lets multiple homeless people sleep in the garage.

And while most minigames are fun, there is only 25 of them - and some of them are just boring. 

Therefore, playernumbers have been dropping, while queuetimes have increased significantly. If you haven’t played the game yet, you’re probably late to the party. If you really want to try the game, I suggest waiting for the start of a new season. Right now, the next one should start ~ October 2020.",False

"The game is really fun, don't get me wrong. I had a blast playing it and if you're reading this then I definitely recommend giving it a try. 

 That being said, This is why I can't give it a full recommendation.

1. The game employs a sort of ""carrot-and-stick"" approach to keep the player going with EXP and a things called ""Kudos."" This means that, even if the player doesn't win they are given a reward to keep them going until they can reach the greater prize being costumes. Each of these things are used to obtain costumes. 

- First you got EXP. EXP levels up the character and gives the player a reward each time such as costumes, emotes or even crowns. 
- Kudos are common points, those can be used to buy simple items from the shop. 
- Finally there is the currency of Crowns which are primarily obtained from winning rounds of the game. These are used to buy special costumes from the shop. Like all the Steam inspired ones from Portal, Team Fortress 2 and Half-Life. but these items are usually locked behind a pretty hefty crown price tag, Like the most expensive I've seen where the whole costume cost 10 crowns (10 wins).

2. But the whole reason they put the carrot-and-stick approach in there is because the game loses it's flavor after about a day if you aren't able to secure a win. Losing can be pretty common in this type of game where you are up against 59 other people and there are no teams to help you. Of course you can play with your friends but, it is still you vs them when the game starts up. Even if you do help each other out, only one of you can get the ""Crown.""

3. Then there are some games that are not balanced. This is really important if one is going to secure a win. I've had games where no matter how well I've done the win can be snatched away because I was put in the back of the line up or someone grabbed me before I could touch the crown at the top of the stage ""King of the Mountain"" (Even though they wouldn't have been able to win themselves.) or a group of players decides to block everyone from crossing a small bridge by just standing on it, like on the map ""Slime Climb."" The point is there is no skill involved, just luck. So if anyone has a really cool or expensive costume I wonder what did they have had to do to get it. Is it the mark of achievement or of trolling everyone behind them over.

Here the problem, for me, lies. You can play 10, 100 or even a thousand games and still never receive more than a few crowns from leveling up that can barely buy the player a cool full costume. Where costumes are the only reason to keep playing the game, this is all just a big waste of time. There is nothing else to gain. I didn't learn to work as a team, or find a way to ""Get Good."" I gained nothing, but a few laughs from the characters falling all over the place and a bunch of anxiety over not being able to win no matter how hard I tried. I just don't have any time for that and if you don't, get past all the cute visuals and noises and see this game for what it really is.",True

Overall I an having fun with these running grabby beans.[h1]- Art-style[/h1] : PG-3 ish overall, totally family friendly and has a nice render for Unity based game. With colorful graphic to catch your attention and make it more playful. Also Sick level grade of sound tracks. Clearly artists know about their jobs.[h1]- Game-play [/h1] : Good and easy to learn game-play. Even your girlfriend, mom or little sibling  who have no idea about gaming world, could easily get into. With very simple controls and map design. You can just watch people doing and have an idea about what is happening in the round without knowing English. Some maps really favor the luck and some being favor the skills, which is good combination for any players with different skills and experiences.[h1]- The bean bag [/h1] : You can dress up your Fall Guy aka the bean. Some people may like to grabby others or some might love to grabbing your butt for your frustration :) Or you could try it yourself, It is fun. Or take an avenging for your fellow bean from the big bully.[h1] The stink bean (con) or what can be improved [/h1]Oh boy... I am not going to say that this game is ""100%"" perfect, as I played and began to noticed many flaws it has. Cannot say it's a polished game but rather need more polishing. [h1]Here some lists of my frustration that I wish to be fixed.[/h1]-Some cosmetic model being clipped, not fully rendered or incorrectly rendered with team game-Fix the OCE server problem, I thought I am S.E.A. server but no, Everyone is playing from North America server after I checked ping and found the truth. So it would be great if I can reduced my latency from 250ms+ to 90ms+ with Singapore server.-Some game mode really favor the better latency player (cough* Tail tag type of game *cough)-Few UI bugs and Regional clock that prevented you from passing result scene.Overall nice game, I give it 7/10",True

I bought this game because I saw streamers play it and it looked like a dumb party game to play for funsies. And it has its moments of silliness, sure. However, every four games or so you will run into cheaters who zoom to the finish line of races, and who levitate back to platforms when they fall. It is impossible for them to be eliminated and they will always win the highly coveted ""crown"" of the match.

This is a significant problem when these crowns, the premium currency with which you buy the best costumes with, are limited to one person per run of about sixty people. It is already difficult to earn crowns legitimately so when you see a cheater, you might as well quit and join another game, because that crown is as good as gone.

Worse, there's no way to report people. Everyone is just ""Fall Guy ####."" Cheaters continue earning crowns and buying costumes while everyone else doesn't stand a chance, and can't do anything about it. It's awful.

Developers, this needs to be fixed before you move on to new costumes or anything else. Really disappointing.",False
Fall guys is a fun game and at first I enjoyed it a lot. Although for the past few weeks I have had numerous hackers. Today I played about six games so far and every game has had one or more hackers. I also have reported many hackers and gotten no feedback. Therefore the lack of anti cheats and effective reporting systems makes this game impossible to win making it pointless.

If you want you can play with friends but others will join too.

If you are looking to buy this game i assume you have probably heard a friend is playing this game or have seen the tons of YouTubers/Twitch streamers play this game, its really popular so far... 


personally, i would recommend this game because of the fun, wacky, cartoonish style this game was made in.
it has really fun mini-games and will get you playing for hours....but...there are some problems too

there seems to be a few glitches in the game that are not yet fixed and every now and again you will see a hacker sprinting at about 100 MPH, but its rare.

another warning to those who are going to use a PC to play this game personally I did not find the controls comfortable but that's personal prefrence.

 Anyway the pros outweigh the cons ....and...  at the time of this writing season 2 has been announced so we know there will be constant updates so that is also something good.

anyway, if u can get fall guys

ALSO - WARNING - There are lots of hackers in this game. They have the ability to fly, which needless to say guarantees a win for them.

I really would like to give it a positive review, as the basis of the game is great fun, there's pretty good balancing (minus some minigames) and it's overall an enjoyable experience.
However I wouldn't buy it just yet...
There's a pretty big issue with hackers right now, that I believe is lessening but every 5-10 games you'll at least get one hacker who just ruins the experience.
There's still quite a few gameplay issues, with connection lag in certain game modes leading to unfair disadvantages due to lag.
There's sometimes some server issues and you don't get rewards for a certain game and have to restart the game.
And finally I think the price is far too high for what content their really is. I don't see more than 15 hours of enjoyable gameplay, and even that's stretching it a fair bit.
If you're reading this in the future with it being even slightly on sale I'd say buy it, but at this moment, not worth the money.

"Fall Guys looks pretty fun, and it can be while playing with a friend, but there are too many problems. Every time you fail it doesn't feel like your fault and instead is pure RNG, hackers, or weird physics. Some of the mini games are fun, but too many of them make you groan when you find out they are selected (egg scramble being one of them). I know many people like this game, but the fact that it is a Battle Royale with half of what you do being subject to luck really messes with what would have been fun competition.  Overall I think this would be an alright game if the price was cheaper and there was better security against hackers. For now though, I can't recommend it.

Fun game ruined by hackers. Devs doing nothing to fix it and trying to gaslight the community by saying hackers are already banned instantly after a round.

Muito divertido de jogar.,True
"The game is nice except that now it is plagued by hackers using cheats to win the rounds. And the depressing thing is that the developers are still not able to fix this shit, nor do they have a proper way for people to report hackers, since the unique ign has been disabled, and the 4-digit name that you are assigned are also used by people in other servers (in other words, they f**ked up real bad and are helpless against these hackers).

In the meantime, the player community seems to be showing more backbones than the developers. If any hackers are spotted in team-play rounds, it is a common consensus that the team with the hacker will suicide so that the hacker can't win(since there is no way for them to win the crown anyway, as the cheater will be the last man standing).

Until the hacker issue has been resolved by the developers, I cannot in my good conscience recommend it to anyone.",False

"""COPY-PASTED from a review on Steam

THE GAME RUNS ENTIRELY CLIENT-SIDE, which means people can blatantly speedhack with no special hack tools. The game also has NO ANTI-CHEAT, AT ALL. The closest thing to anti-cheat is a single text channel in the game's official Discord where you can manually report cheaters, which, surprise, doesn't actually get any cheaters banned.

Users were able to use HTML in their Steam username to make their names appear large or colorful in-game. I never once saw this used for anything malicious yet the developers went nuclear and decided that, RATHER THAN FIXING the html injection, to just force every single player's in-game name to ""Fall Guy ####"". WHY NOT JUST FIX THE HTML IN USER'S NAMES. Let me give your programmers a hint, it's called input sanitization, you can look up a tutorial for it on YouTube and actually do your job.

So with those two problems coupled together, yeah let me just go and file a report against someone with nothing but the username ""Fall Guy 1234"" to go on—I can't even track their Steam account through recent games. Keep in mind also that this game has a million-some players and there are only 4 digits in each randomized name, so there are going to be several dozen duplicates of each numerical name. The devs couldn't track that to a player even if they wanted to, so no one is getting banned for cheating. Great work guys. It's only going to get worse as the game goes on if nothing gets fixed.

Hackers are a real problem at the moment. The lack of anti cheat means that you're bound to be in a lobby with a hacker every other game. Besides this It's a real good but It's hard to stay invested when you get to the final round and the hacker just flies their way to the finish.,False

"Likes: finally a PC party game

Dislikes: I seem to get knocked over for reasons I dont understand. I almost wish they would remove that feature as its more random and annoying than skill based to win. Also some crown levels where you simple race forward to the crown is non winnable if you are not in the front row when the match starts as if you and the person in the front row make no mistakes he/she will win simply out of luck vs skill. Also the cheaters make it very frustrating. I have cheaters while I am live streaming ruin the game. One in fact took my crown and it made me rage LOL.

"This game could be a lot of fun. But guess what? It's not in its current state and the dev team doesn't help. 

First, the physics and collisions in the game are a real pita, resulting in weird map/objects/characters interactions. Not to mention all the bugs, the illogical ragdoll behaviors and the servers latency, showing on your screen something COMPLETELY different than what is actually happening to the other players around you (be it their position, their posture, their speed, and so on).

But now comes the most annoying thing... Did you guess?

Yes! Cheaters. All over the place. 3 games out of 5 is containing at least 1 cheater, fully equipped with 10 crowns total value outfits.

And the icing on the cake, we get Mediatonic's dev team communicating about their ""anti cheat tool"" being able to track cheaters on their first game using a speed hack and taking actions instantly.

So please explain to me how cheaters can have 10 wins worth of outfits and still be able to play the damn game?

Now what really hurts:

They are currently applying a very strict censorship policy on social medias, deleting anything related to cheaters to prevent anyone from reporting these issues. They've even got to the point where they tried to take over the non official Fall Guys subreddit to have their hands on that one too (after all the deletions about cheaters on the official one).

I'm very worried about the future of the game and how they will handle their community is a disaster.

Sure there are sometimes hackers, very occasional server disconnections and some trashier minigames (Perfect Match.) There's no denying it is addictive, wholesome, competitive and fun.

"Try this basic recipe for fail-safe biscuits every time. Make a batch of chocolate chip cookies, or adapt it to include nuts, fruit or your favourite sweets

STEP 1
Beat the butter and sugar together with an optional pinch of sea salt in a bowl until light and fluffy, then beat in the eggs one at a time. Sift over the flour and cocoa powder and beat into the butter mix, then fold through the chocolate chips. The mix can be made up to 2 days ahead and chilled or frozen for a month, or used straight away.

STEP 2
To bake, heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. If the mix is at room temperature, place evenly spaced spoonfuls on parchment-lined baking sheets, allowing 2 tbsp for each cookie. If the mix is fridge cold, you can roll it into 40g balls before baking. The balls can be frozen and the biscuits baked from frozen, but they’ll need a few minutes more. Bake for 12-15 mins until spread out and crusty around the outside. Leave to cool slightly and enjoy warm, or leave to cool completely and eat cold. The biscuits will keep in a tin for three days.

STEP 3
As an optional extra, the biscuits can be dipped in chocolate. To do this, melt your chosen type of chocolate in a bowl over a pan of simmering water or in the microwave. Leave to cool a little, then dip half of each biscuit in the chocolate and leave them on parchment-lined trays somewhere cool to set. Again, the dipped biscuits will keep for up to three days in a tin or lidded plastic container.",True

After several minutes he flew to the end and won instantly. All other players instantly eliminated.

Getting to the finals against a fly hacker basically ruins the game completely. The ONLY goal of the game is to win. Three of the four championships are unwinnable against a fly hacker and the fourth is still incredibly difficult (and rare as well).

"This game is very good. It is very fun and worth getting.

It has very good gameplay, very fun levels and maps, and it has some lovely strategy in some levels, and it is great fun to play with friends.
The controls are easy to understand for most gamers (in my opinion) and the colours of the game give off a happy feeling that makes you want to keep playing no matter how many rounds are lost.
The longer it takes and the harder you work to get to the end makes it feel ever more satisfying to finally reach the crown.
It is a very lovely game that gamers are sure to enjoy for a very long time.

- below are the very specific areas of the game I dislike. (all of which seem to be either bugs or accidental)
contrast switching between different loading screens or switching between players in spectator mode cause a sudden change of colour that is an epileptic hazard. (changing this to a fade in/out would fix it)
Loading screen that shows a shuffle of images of different maps to be loaded goes by slightly too fast and also causes such a hazard. (slowing it down slightly would fix it)
Occasionally when loading a game or loading the mainmenu there is a black screen that blinks in for a moment and then is gone, this is also a hazard.
There is also a solid white screen that usually appears around the same time as the black one but directly after, which makes it a worse hazard. (both could be fixed by changing the way it loads to a fade in/out with mid tone colours or greys instead of solid black and white)",True

I purchased my game several weeks ago and it really was quite fun at first. However, shortly after the first hacks appeared. They keep ruining every single game and the developers don't give a damn about it. You'll spend hours and hours trying to win a game, but in the end, there's pretty much a cheater in every game who will reveal himself in the final round - which is, frankly, quite frustrating. Just browse these forums and you'll find plenty of people complaining about it.

On top of that, there's quite a few issues with the servers, resulting in disconnecting regularly. So all in all, not worth buying. Not until they fix their hackers and their servers.",False

The Grand Prix battle royale is here guys... Join your friends' lobby and throw them off of conveyor belts to their doom; it's time to PARTY. Fall Guys is a Battle Royale game with elements similar to those of Takeshi Castle (if you're into Japanese Ninja Warrior type of TV shows). I'll explain in detail: you get to customize one jellybean, win rounds to get to the finals... Now those rounds are randomized mostly, it's like a bit of lottery. How do you win rounds? By avoiding obstacles, going up conveyor belts, mastering the art of jumping, and ragdolling your way to the finish line while taunting the other players behind you. Now believe me when I tell you that this is the most successful game of 2020, for all the good reasons. The fun to be had with friends here is immeasurable. You'll find yourself queuing for more after every loss thinking you've figured it all out, only to die at the same spot and queue again trying different approaches every time. I personally haven't had such fun in a videogame in almost a decade; it's almost too addicting.

The only complaint one might have for this game is THE TEAM GAMES. ""Fall Ball"", to this day, is still my worst game but mainly since I manage to always score a couple of goals while my team scores on our own goal, shamelessly so... Or maybe that's just my being salty speaking, but still the fact remains that Team Games are usually unbalanced/luck based. The hacking is also an issue in this game, as some will hide their true vile intentions and wait until you've made it past your fourth round to start flying around to the finish line on races AND/OR headbutting a ball so hard it flies through the screen and into your own goal. 

All in all, this is an absolute MUST if you're into Battle Royale / Mario Party kind of games. This is a solid 9.7/10 and it would absolutly get a 10/10 IF: ONE, the devs somehow manage to dramatically reduce cheating in the game (probably by implementing a better ANTI-HACKING system) and TWO, the devs add ladders and a seperate team mode for people who are in a party that would alternate between individual courses and team ones. Good work there devs, I'm really in for supporting you all the way to the FINISH LINE (hopefully there won't be a finish line since this game is the best thing that happened during this pandemic)",True

It's a great game to chill and have fun with friends but the hacking problem is out of control (Why would you even hack in this game 😂?) . Getting multiple hackers in 60-70 percent of my games.

It can be a great game if they solve the hacking problem.,False

GG,True
"First off the only positive thing and thats the coreidea of the game which is actually brilliant and crazy nobody else have picked this up before. Even more sad that its even possible to screw it up that badly and there we go to the endless list of bad things...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Cheater (releasing this game without proper anticheat what a brainfart)

2. Servers (I totally get that they have been overwhelmed at the beginning but as of today apart of pure downtime servers have gotten not better at all even worse. Jump Final and Hexagon are horrible on bad Servers, dont get me started on grabbing people on bad servers - what a fun time...)

Just these 2 points should totally be enough to get a refund at any point because thats simply something you have no control about until they fix these 2 points. There is this 5 Win Streak Achievment - maybee change that to 5 lobbies in a row without hacker or disconnect from lobby. I mean rewardserver are always down aswell - every few matches you even have to ALT+F4 just to get out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lets keep going....

3. Teamgames playing Solo without Matchmaking what a bloddy stupid idea. Some dont even move and just wait it out but mostly its just up to RNG if you get into a team which isnt absolutely full of braindead people. There isnt a single Teamgame you can consisently carry solo, 

4. Overtime is stupid af (There is nothing better than being first like 3 times and get eliminated in 4th ot...I mean why not let those 2 looserteam battle it out that would be to easy right

5. Max players per map still needs so much adjustment. 15 player Fall Mountain or 20 people Hexagon - how do you even get that idea that could work and make fun

6. Mapdesign - my personal favorite is jinx game here. why not make the map even smaller to maximze fun...really its just so dumb. Solo Tailgrabmap is just horrible designed and boring - just stand around and grab one at the end instead ff doing a decent map where you can actually do something. Grabbing tail is stupid anyways because the last 10 secs are only important. Why not make it timebased from the beginning - to easy again...and yeah I thought about but you got a tail at the start - well throw them in the middle and you need to pick them up first.

7. Maprotation - its so predictable and repeating. THere is no way every map for the current round has the same chance. Round 2 or game before FInal and itself is so often the same over a whole session...just why...

8. Inventory - First of the UI is so dam slow it take ages to go through stuff. Additional to that no presets, no filter. Thats just gonna end up in a big mess.

9. Shop - Am I the only one realizing that the shop is straight up scam...There is so much stuff you dont want and now comes the catch...if you dont buy it you also dont get it out of the rotation and they put it back there over and over again. In order to get 5 new items you literally have to buy stuff you dont even want and you end up being low on Kudos meaning you have to buy kudos...brilliant scam idea to get into kids money. I sit on so many kudos and have literally one full skin and well legendary skins which werent that great either tbh and the normal one comes actually from the pass. If people dont realize this you cant help them...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have absolutely no idea what they did in Beta and most importantly how this game even got out of beta because the current state is barely beta...

Pretty sure I forgot a bunch but this was just out of the top of my head. Its actually sad because this could really be the #1 partygame and a lot of fun for long time but they screwed up so much and improved almost nothing since release. Took them ages to even out teamgames (what a joke - forgot about that) or spectate squadmembers first...

well what a shame...if they dont make 180° changes until 2nd season the game will die faster than it was hyped at the beginning and totally deserved...problem is they scammed 20€ or more from us for such a broken game People need rethink their requirements for a videogame because thats why we only get one game after another which comes with a great coreidea but other than that its gets completey destroyed just to make money...No idea how people can give this game a positive rating - it should never be positive...

"Until they solve the problem with cheaters, do not spend your $20. They keep claiming to be working on fixing the ""hackers"" but why does their platform allow for cheaters in the first place? This is a battle royal where you compete for a crown. The whole purpose of the game goes down the toilet when you make it to the final and a cheater suddenly can fly or run fast. It is impossible to win against a cheater and they claim they are working on the problem to keep you playing but the issue has gotten worse and worse where every game I have played recently has been won by a cheater. The kicker? There is no where to report the cheaters because they say, ""don't worry, we are working on it!"" They have been ""working on it"" since the game release!

1. there are a lot of CHEATERS, well lets say u play this game for 10 matches, in those 10 matches, AT LEAST u will find one or two cheaters on your way, there's no way you can beat cheaters, they can just jump really high to get rid of the obstacles, flying around the map, some even mess around you to get you eliminated, and some even just blink right from the starting point to the finish line. It's frustrating, did i just pay a decent amount of money just to get messed by cheaters?

2. stuck at the 'LOOKING FOR PLAYERS' screen, it didn't occur when i started playing this game on my first & second day since i first installed this game, it occurred on the third day and on, usually it takes less than a minute to find a match, but recently, it took me HALF AN HOUR to get to the match, this is just getting ridiculous, i tried getting it fix by finding the solution on the internet, but it didnt help at all, troubleshooting? done. relog the game relog the pc? done, end task with task manager? done. look for the compatibility on steam and fallguys client and tick 'run as administrator'? done. i've done so many things but the result is the same. The thing is even after the long wait has ended, when i finally found myself a match, cheaters are already on my doorstep. I wait half an hour just to get messed by cheaters? and i need to wait for another 30 mins? should i refund this game already?

3. This is the last issue regarding this game so far, at least from what i experience, i wont put any other issues if i didnt experience it myself, the last one is 'disconnected from the server'. i have a good internet connection, i played overwatch, gta online, valorant, csgo, and many other games which required a good wifi connection and i dont encounter any problem with internet connection, except for this game. Sometimes i got disconnected at the beginning of a round, middle, and sometime even at the final round. When this happened at the final round, i say i had enough, i decided to put a review on this game. a bad one, i dont know what to say anymore. u better not give away your money for this game unless this problems are fixed. dude, u wont be able to play anyway.

In conclusion, this game has a lot of potential, but there are issues, and these issues are frustrating, i hope the game developer or fallguys's staff will take a note or two on this review, fix these problems, then i will comeback with another review.",False

"Overall is a good game, good graphics, a lots of minigames (race type and team type) but there is something that ruins everything, the servers!!!! fix them!!  the grab has a 3 km range! this bug makes the tail game and other games impossible to play! and another thing, add some kind of cheat report, it's very annoying to see people flying around the map :|",False

"Honestly it's not bad, but there are problems. Hackers are starting to become a round-to-round occurrence and some games are just suited for a number of players - slime climb in 40 players ended in 7 players getting to the end. 
Those are tolerable and the game is enjoyable. For 98% of the experience.
But when you get ragdolled - fall face flat and take a nap - completely at random, with nobody around you, on flat ground, standing still and you lose because of it it gets frustrating. Very.  It has happened to me twice. If they fix this, I'll change my review to positive. But right now I doubt the amount of fun you'll have when you lose because of bs. As a result the 2% are so sucky they equal the rest 98%.",False
"The game itself is fun, but the cheaters ruin it. The devs say the automated anticheat system is present, but I have encountered so many high level characters that have physics disabled and just float in the air. There's no way to report cheaters too: even a button that would allow reporting a dishonest match winner at the end of the game would be a huge help.",False

Its hard to win, definitely harder to not get pissed off by hurls of jellybean dudes shoving and grabbing you, tossing you about as you helpless fall behind everyone else, leading to your elimination. Fall Guys is a great game, you get tons of laughter and memorable experiences, such as realising our human population does not understand the physics of a seesaw. Honestly, this game is pretty pricey so check with your doctor your blood pressure before deciding to buy and play Fall Guys. The only thing falling is your jellybean, while your blood pressure is on a steady increase! (*this review may or may not be a sarcastic joke*)",True

- How can he grab my tail from 5 meters away but I can't grab his tail even when i'm in his back ?!

"very infuriating game not helped by the endless heap of hackers and bugs. If the devs don't want this to instantly die out and crash the hype train. do us all a favor, fix the fucking hacker situation and implement an actual anti-cheat. We don't want to hear that the hackers are ""banned on their first game"" because that is very obviously bullshit. I and many others have seen hackers with 10 crown skins. Do yourself a favor and don't give into the hype of this game until/IF they get their shit together and fix the very clear problems.",False

"Wacky antics await as 60 suggestively shaped contestants ""woo"" their way to almost certain doom in the pernicious pits of pink slime that perpetually pursue them. However, one must be declared winner in this unconventional battle royale; will it be you? Probably not but with quick 10-15 minute matches and minimal downtime between games, figure 1-2 minutes if the servers cooperate, what's it matter?

This game absolutely nails the enjoyment of platformers and marries that to competitive Battle Royale eliminations with a heaping helping of ""Wipeout"" inspired zaniness suffusing the currently 24 mini-games. Is it frustrating to lose in a team game or the 2nd or even 5th round? Of course! Yet one will find the feeling fleeting as the next game is a mere button press away with the promise that this may be the one that you win.

Having never played a battle royale, it was the aesthetics, flippancy, and pure potential for pronounced shenanigans that made this stand out to me and I do not regret a single minute I have poured into this game. Highly recommend. Play with friends, laugh when they are eliminated, and bare witness to the first battle royale worthy of its popularity. Don't @ me",True

If you want to be part of a funny japanese game show yourself, this is the game for you. 60 players compete against each other and everyone wants to win. A colorful world packed with cool designed levels, with a steady learning curve. There are in game purchases which are very optional and do not give any advantage. All kinds of skins are also easy to get by playing the game. There are definitely some things that can and should be improved by the developers but I am sure they are already working on it. If you play in higher levels and have better opponents, you'll encounter a lot of hackers at the moment, which unfortunately ruin the game. But this is still being worked on at the moment and it shouldn't stop you from playing the game. GTA V finally also play some despite the hackers. In any case, do not miss it and give the game a chance. You can still give it back on Steam it shouldn't really be for you.",True

The way rounds are decided seems dumb, could be 3rd or 4th round in with 10 people left and it decides to put you in fall ball instead of a just going straight to finals?

Fun and honestly probably the one game 2020 needed the most, but I would be lying if I said the game felt like it has a long life right now:

[list]
    [*]Hackers are becoming an increasing problem each day. It's now gotten to the point where I'm only really playing it to play with friends. They need to actually take action about it soon. (EDIT: They finally have anti-cheat now.)

    [*]The party system is currently very weak. If you get eliminated, you'll enter a spectator mode and always need to manually scroll through all active players until you find one of your friends for every single round just to watch them. This is especially awful because everyone is named ""Fall Guy ####"" right now thanks to a previous exploit. They are at least planning to patch this.

    [*]A lot of the maps leave the player helpless, which makes for some extremely infuriating eliminations. See-Saw pretty much always leaves you at the mercy of idiots surrounding you to decide your fate. Egg Scramble boils down to everyone harassing the weakest team because it's the easiest way to win. Block Party has this nasty bug where your feet can get stuck inside one of the obstacles if you jump/land on the corner of it. Perfect Match always feels like a waste of time since you can just look at where everyone's going if you weren't paying attention...

    [*]You can only play with a maximum of 4 friends. There is no private mode.

    [*]You're probably going to see every single stage in the game within an hour.

If you are from Australia or another country within OCE, you will probably have a similar situation. That being said, Fall Guys is a must have game!

"An absolute blast of a game. If you are a fan of Mario Party mini games but more competitive, or just a genuinely good game and experience, buy this game. I cannot recommend this game enough. It never started to feel repetitive despite playing all the mini games over and over again. There's a joy and satisfaction of learning each game and perfecting it to get a win (which I'm still trying to get one). However, there are some balance issues and the ever so present hacker menace. But even then, despite its flaws, it is a very charming and fun experience, with more on it's way. My experience has been filled with happiness to rage. I love my cute little Jellybean, and I know I will be on top for at least one game, and boy it feels satisfying qualifying before a giant crowd, being first in front of a pack of up to 50+ people shoving and pushing eachother.

The community (much like the TF2 community) is very close and very welcoming, throwing their own games if they find someone hacking. They are fantastic, and the devs (unlike the TF2 community) are very present. It's simply the right way to make a game. It's fresh, it's fun, and dare I say it might as well be timeless. Even for someone like me who HATES battle royale games (such as Fortnite, PUBG, and others), this has rapidly become one of my favourite games I have ever played. I can't wait to see the game and the community flourish even more, and I hope the devs keep the players in mind instead of the money.

There is someone on the other side..... running frantically to the crown, making sure he strippes this crown from you. ""I HAVEN'T COME THIS FAR TO BACK DOWN NOW!!!!!!!!!"", you yell frantically. You push on the W key so hard that you hear your keyboard cracking. But you must continue. You jump all the stair flawlessly... but so did he. You put every single ounce of force you possibly can on the W key, you are almost there! You jump to grab the crown, as he jumps for the crown at the same time. You Hold your shift key with with determination............... Round over. You lost..... All this hard work.... gone...... stripped away from you. Then you uninstall. gg",True

"Very fun game. Currently 4 hours at time of review. 

From what I've seen there is nice diversity in maps, though it could do with more. Though I think per season we will have a change up and rotation of maps, so new will likely come out soon. Aside from that, I probably see hackers in maybe 10-15% of the games I play? To say the game cannot be family shared, I feel a reduction needs to be made. Though the game is entirely playable IMO with the amount of hackers currently. Hopefully within time that will be sorted more so. Very fun cute game :D",True
very shit :D,True
"This quote I read on reddit before I got the game is a very apt description of my feelings towards Fall Guys:

""The thing that makes fall guys stand out as a BR for me is how it de-emphasizes the investment in games, if that makes sense.

In Blackout, Fornite, Apex, Warzone, PUBG, etc. You have to spend 20 minutes looting and setting up and then hiding in a bush or trying to be aggressive only to either be sniped, outbuilt, or just feck up.

It's infuriating, it feels like you're wasting time.

But with fall guys, I don't feel that, by keeping the gamemodes random and short, it negates all of the above.

Add to that the earning of credits regardless how well you do, and more if you do better, and you have a winner.

The silly atmosphere and physics definitely help with easing the tension, and even when I get fecked with shizzy teammates on team games, another shot at the win is merely 10 minutes away.""",True
"The game can be fun and all, but it really got a lot of bugs and glitches, and it is unbelievable how many hackers this game got in such a short amount of time. It almost feels like, that the hackers are putting more effort into the game by creating hacks then the devs. The gameplay itself is just questionable, e. g. when somebody steals your tail from a 5 m distance. This game really needs it´s servers fixed and a anti-cheat system has to be built in, with a report function of course. All in all, it just needs an entire reboot. I am not telling anyone to not buy it, but if nothing changes until the next season, I´ll probably never set an eye on this game ever again.",False

"[b]TL;DR: decent game but ruined by the team-based minigames, the bugs and the cheaters.[/b]

Fall Guys is now world renowned and has sold over 7 million copies so clearly my opinion will bear little over its success, although I'm not here to flame it but warn some people about what they're going to play.
It's a good game but I can't really recommend it. Please let me elaborate if this puzzles you.

[h1]The good:[/h1]
+ The game is super cute, looks and sounds fun. There's no real universe or lore but everything works really well and you'll want to play just for its lighthearted atmosphere.

+ While the physics-based controls are nowhere near Mario or Celeste quality in terms of accuracy, they do a good job and are mostly there to add enough chaos so that the game doesn't become skill-based. Skill does matter, but overall it's just about the fun and how well you fare among the crowd and the obstacles. Do not purchase if you think this is a top-class platformer; it is not and doesn't pretend to be. It doesn't feel super great but it feels good enough for what it's trying to achieve.

+ It's super easy to pick up and dive in a game. If you lose, you can try again quickly. The devs did a really good job with the matchmaking and menu flow.

[h1]The less good (let's be honest, the bad):[/h1]
- Expect glitches. And I mean LOTS OF THEM. To be honest I was pretty sure this was an early Early Access build, only to be surprised to learn that it was, indeed, a full release. The devs still have a ton of work to do to make this game clean enough to be called a final product.

- There are lots of grievers and cheaters that exploit the game is every dirty way possible. There's no way to report them, so they just ruin the fun for everyone else, and go unpunished as far as I know.

- Last but not least, the devs somehow thought that it was a good idea to include team-based minigames with random teams in a battle royale. While this might (with lots of imagination) sound like a a great idea, especially when playing with friends, it is absolutely terrible when you're playing solo. Just end up on the wrong team and you'll get eliminated regardless of how well you're playing or how hard you're trying. You're basically being eliminated based on pure luck. This is actually my biggest beef with the game! I would much prefer to be able to opt out of team-based minigames and do only solo rounds, and have a separate mode featuring ONLY team-based minigames. I'm not even salty when I lose in solo because it's usually my fault, even when a griever is involved, I can tell myself ""I should've avoided that"". But when I lose because my team sucks or just outright rage quits or obviously goes AFK, my reaction is ""I couldn't possibly have avoided that outcome.""

- All in all, the game feels drab pretty quickly and all those cheap cosmetic rewards and over-the-top chaos give the impression that the game was made primarily with streamers and youtubers in mind, which is obviously a great commercial strategy, judging by the sales, but that doesn't make for a very long-appealing game. It might well be more fun to watch than play, which is not really a product I'd like to put my money on.

I'm asking for a refund and may probably pick up the game again with a heavy discount later, if, however, the devs make the team-based minigames a separate mode (or get rid of them entirely because let's be honest, they wouldn't be missed).",False

Yeah currently everyone is speaking this game but after big titles release like Cyberpunk 2077, Watch Dogs Legion (not big enough but ok lmao), Avengers, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Halo Infinite and etc. most of the people will forget it.

[h1]Who would like this game[/h1]
If you liked playing Mario Party with your friends and enjoyed the mini games in particular, I suspect you will like this. (Also check out Pummel Party if you want something more like Mario Party).

[h1]Pros[/h1]
- Fun. My favorite game in here is Hex-A-Gone because of the strategies that can be employed, but I like the others (See Saw, Slime Climb, Whirlygig, and Fruit Chute are good)
- Good performance on all my rigs, doesn't seem to need much (my friend with a GTX 680 from 2012 reports it runs fine on their rig)
- At this point, the netcode feels polished and I don't have many failed matchmaking attempts any longer (this was bad at launch but seems mostly fixed now)
- No way to communicate with others outside of simple emotes makes the game a refreshing bit of wholesomeness.
- Soundtrack is pretty good

[h1]Where does this game get it right where others don't?[/h1]
It's fun even if you lose.

I think the biggest crime other 1 vs. many games make (looking at PUBG, Fortnite), is that they are not fun when you lose (for me at least). You will spend a long time in the ""gather supplies"" phase, which is essentially an RNG, and many times you will be sniped by someone that you didn't see miles away. This is a time waste IMO. With 100 people, you are likely to lose and spend large portions of your time not actually playing the fun part of the game (which is duking it out with other people). Sure, there are ways of preventing this and optimizing your path to victory, but they often make the game less fun  (hiding from enemies, etc...).

Fall Guys on the other hand lets you play the fun part of the game as soon as the counter hits zero. This game is basically a few selected minigames from the Mario Party franchise boosted to support up to 60 players with a strong emphasis on platforming. The game starts with ~60 people, and there are multiple rounds. During each round ~33% of the players are eliminated until there are ~7-15 players left, and they compete under a final round.

Why is it fun to lose?

Because of the low number of players eliminated each round, you get a sense of victory even when completing the early rounds in game, and when you lose later, it isn't crushing as each game only lasts 10-20 minutes. The ways you die are often very out there as well, and you will often laugh when you die; e.g. it's always hilarious to see a friend die during the very easy fruit-memory game. There are surprisingly few trolls here despite the opportunities to do so, trolling often impacts your own ability to win and is risky in itself.

Also, I think 60 simultaneous players max is more reasonable than 100 players.

[h1]Areas of improvement[/h1]
This is an overall well made game, but nothing is perfect except maybe Stardew Valley.

- It's unfortunate that the usernames are still not visible (apparently there was an exploit where the game doesn't properly escape formatting tags allowing others to make usernames take up the entire screen)
  - Always sanitize user input or forever be cursed by ""Bobby Tables""!
- Spectator view improvements:
  - Make it easier to identify friends
  - Free camera mode?
- We have noticed a few cheaters that can simply levitate to avoid falling? This should be easy to detect and should be fixed.
- Would be fun to play with a 5 player group (4 is the max group size)",True

"It's fun, but if you don't live close to the servers (If you usually have an average ping of like 100 or more in games) then you can pretty much forget about having any sort of impact on the soccer based games. Also grabbing other people has a weird effect with high ping where you'll get rubberbanded around even when nobody's around.

Still, the game is pretty neat and the obstacle course levels are a hoot and a half so I'd recommend it.
Heck maybe the devs will add more servers or implement some anti-lag tech of some sort in the future.",True

"This is a very fun game. Easy to pick up and understand, but takes plenty of time/practice to get consistent results and wins. As long as they keep it frequently updated, it should always be fun to return to. Right now in Season One, some rounds are pretty frustrating, especially team ones. They can make you feel like you lose without any regard for your own agency as a player.",True
"Okay, NOW I'M GETTING BORED.
I literally HATE that minigame where you have to catch the opponent tail and compared to the football one is such a blast absurd that i can touch myself on it.
EVERY SINGLE TIME SOMEONE STEAL MY TAIL WHILE SCREAMING GOMU GOMU NOOOOOOOOOOOOO, but if i want to steal someone else tail, I have to touch him worse than the devil and also put a stick up his rectum.
But i still LOVE THE GAME, and each time i scream i enjoy more the game and i'm getting more closer and closer to my fateful moment.
Luckily you can hug other people, and it arouse me each time.",True

"A bright, colorful, cute game that anyone can pick up and play right away. Albeit with some struggles at first... Is even MORE fun if you have friends to grab and take with you to scream at each other when completing tasks.

While I do recommend this game for those that want something to pick up and play quickly, it does have some setbacks in my opinion:
   - The $20 price tag is a bit too high. $5 or maybe $10 would of sufficed. It would of made it more accessible for people who don't have a lot of money and are just want something to play that'll take their mind away from the scary world outside in this year of 2020.
   - If you try to take a gander at how the game will be and look like based on screenshots here and trailers shown in the past, you'll be a bit dissapointed to know that some of these aren't in the final game, and some of the visual changes are a little worse than what was shown.
   - Minigames. While there is quite a few minigames, I personally think is still too little. Once you play the game for an hour or 2, you'll have replayed the same minigames dozens of times as you did before. This consequently makes the game boring and repetitive to play over time until they release more maps and more game modes in the future which could take a few months in between.",True

"Really fun and cute game. Has the potential to become an actual esport battle royale game. The only problem for now is the anti-cheat. As the game was released this month, the amount of cheaters is lot. Hopefully they will fix it in latter updates. Also they need to fix synchronization of ping. Sometimes when someone is playing tail tag or even royal fumble, a player is shown grabbing a tail when we are literally 5 ft apart. Apart from that, the game is very good and worth the price (529 INR). If i get the chance to play this game professionally, I would not hesitate!!",True

"Fall Guys is a fun game to play with friends, and only friends. It's infuriating to play on your own. With friends, you're having fun in the races and minigames. The team games become a little more possible because you can coordinate with your team, and if you get eliminated in a race or minigame you can root for your friends. 

On your own however the game becomes a little mundane. The races boil down to move forward and jump every so often. It becomes someone monotonous once you reach the games very low skill ceiling. Even if you're the best at the game it doesn't really matter. You'll get eliminated because your team gets bullied, you'll get eliminated because the map glitches out and carries you to your death, you'll get eliminated because someone gently bumped into you causing you to ragdoll into the sun. Even if you do manage to get to the victory round, you'll most likely get cheated out of a win from someone hacking the game, or from the servers connection being terrible. Usually it's the terrible connection. 

The game is a buggy unbalanced mess that is only enjoyable to play with friends or when high. If it goes on sale, pick it up. Might have some fun. If you have friends to play it with, for sure pick it up. Otherwise, leave it alone.",False

"Fall Guys is a great concept of a game: it's fast paced, you try to beat 59 other people for the crown, and ragdolls. The physics in this game are infuriating. Now, this wouldn't be to bad if you were the reason it was flopping on the floor. But if another player hits you whilst ragdolling, guess what? YOU ragdoll. It's so infuriating because there's nothing you can do about it. Another problem with this game is the grabbing element in this. Great in theory, bad in practice. Other players have the ability to grab you and keep you from moving or mess up a jump your taking. It gives internet trolls a whole new set of powers.

I personally more see it like an elimination game or like a competetive roblox obby course for those that played that as a kid. 

Yes the game is 20$ but there is no extra cost after this, there is no content locked behind dlc and the updates that come out aren't behind a paywall either, you play to earn here and if you think 20$ is a lot then I think you should look at other games around you that cost the same or even more that still charge you for dlc etc. 

I bought this for myself and my brother so a total of 40$ and I am not regretting it one bit, it was worth every penny. 

This game has a banging soundtrack and it's a lot of fun to play.


Now for the negatives, the few things that irk me about this game is the teamgames at times, and especially the tail tag gamemodes, I feel like these should be dependant on who HELD it the LONGEST rather than who is lucky to have it last second. Going hand in hand with this complaint is the occasional disconnect/Server crash and you get launched back to the lobby, robbed of your final round.

"Fall Guys is an excellent party-style battle royale game, often reminiscent of Mario Party in its core gameplay.  The game has a decent offering of fun obstacle courses and the mixture of a huge group of ridiculous characters and cartoonish physics makes for a consistently hilarious experience.


[b]I have a few major gripes with the game[/b]:
[list]
[*] Sabotage is a disproportionately powerful mechanic for making others lose the game.  As far as I'm aware, none of the games that Fall Guys takes inspiration from allow any kind of gameplay where sacrificing oneself to sabotage others is so absurdly effective in making others lose.  Not only is sabotage a primary strategy for winning in team-based games, it's very common to see people throw their own chances to 'grief' as many other players as possible.  I'd like to see this mechanic tuned back or for there to be some sort of consistent counterplay.  There are situations when it's literally impossible to succeed if others focus on making you fail.

[*] Winning some of the different game modes seems more dependent on RNG than on skill. At times, your initial placement before the match starts can make a huge difference because bumping into others slows you down or can even just knock you over and put you behind.  In some of these maps, being ahead is the only way to not have your fate sealed by all the other players around you.

[*] The controls are very clunky and unresponsive.  Perhaps the controls were meant to add more challenge and variation to the game, but when you have over 50 other players around you and often rushing to run along the exact same path you're on, it makes the game extremely uncertain and makes you more dependent on luck.  Big groups of players in cramped spaces with unresponsive controls and mechanics that can very easily knock your over onto your face makes for some hilarious spectacle, but it can be very frustrating if you're playing well and still lose to the physics.

[*] We spend [b][i]way[/i][/b] too much time sitting in menus and loading screens.  I haven't actually taken the time to record how long you spend playing the game versus sitting and waiting, but my [i]conservative[/i] guess is that at least a third of all your time playing is loading screen, watching a preview of the map, watching the 'elimination screen', loading screen again, rinse, repeat.  I feel that the in-between moments need to be sped up pretty significantly.  It would actually make losing a lot less frustrating because jumping back into the game and getting the endorphins back could happen much faster.  I don't know if it's a technical limitation and if all those different moments of waiting are actually necessary to load the games, but I'd love to see the waiting time be scaled back a lot.
[/list]

It's already been pointed out to me that I might care a little too much about the game's balance issues and that's fair -- This game isn't an esport and it certainly does accomplish it's goal of being ridiculously entertaining.  This game might be a bit too bland to justify the $20 USD price tag only looking at it's current state, but just a month after launch, Mediatonic has shown off Fall Guys' season 2 along with some plans for new content and game modes.  This game has some glaring issues, but those issues are really the only things that stand in the way of it being absolutely incredible.  Fall Guys is an engrossing experience that anyone who enjoys party games should play.",True
I want my $23 back,False
fun.,True
"Fantastic and fun game, best played with friends for maximum fun.",True
"Despite the gameplay actually being fun, the random lag, prevalence of hackers, and unreasonable wait times forces me to turn you away from the game unless these issues are all fixed.

Depending on the time you play the game, and whether or not your computer is garbage or decent, you will experience stutters on occasion. If you live in a region where there are no nearby servers, good luck playing a game where everyone isn't constantly warping or shoving you out of the arena. If you DO have a beefy computer and strong connection to a server, you are still not exempt from experiencing sudden lag syndrome.

Hackers have been appearing shortly after release(I didn't play during the beta, so I'm not sure if they existed before then). You can't report hackers in-game though... why?

A report function doesn't exist in-game, because the developers claim that their anti-cheat system works to get rid of hackers quickly(it doesn't). You can still submit a claim through their website, but even there they tell you it's pointless. They're not wrong, because every account was assigned a random 4 digit name(something about steam IDs not displaying properly when you use certain characters), which can be shared by hundreds of others. You would have to ALSO provide your support ID(unique ID that for some reason isn't used as your name instead) in order to submit a ticket, because that would be the ONLY way of knowing which specific game that hacker you are reporting was in.

So you have your support ID, and you took a screenshot or recording of the cheater. You sent the report, so now that cheater will be banned, right? Well, there are numerous hackers that STREAM the game while cheating, gaining dozens of crowns, without getting banned despite dozens of reports and the ""anti-cheat"" system. Any that do eventually get banned have ruined FAR more than a single game. Teaming up on hackers is a thing, which can be gratifying, but that's not supposed to be a part of the gameplay.

If you wanted to leave a game because a hacker is present, you would have to wait until after the current match ends, or else you will lose out on any kudos(in-game currency) that you accumulated during the current show(round of matches). So, your options are: lose out on the kudos and time you spent playing until a hacker inevitably appears by quitting during a match, wait/play out the match until it ends so you can then quit and keep your kudos, or play the game hoping a hacker isn't present. Not to mention that if you try to quit as soon as you die, but the match ends immediately, you have to wait for the next stage to be selected, the map to load, and the match to actually start, before you can quit.",False

However as you progress you start to care less about the dumb fun and care more about winning and progression and that's when the bad RNG nature of the game starts becoming a burden.

Overall it's worth buying but I think for long term appeal and replayability they will have to remove some of the RNG elements like team games otherwise it'll die as fast as it grew. Getting randomly knocked out for being on a useless team which is essentially just a random roll, especially on the 2nd from last round is extremely frustrating.

The game also suffers from quite bad design, you can't just leave a match whenever you want, the exit game button is located in the options menu, it has all the hallmarks of a good idea with less than ideal execution. Some of these things I think can be fixed over time and with feedback, but whether it's worth playing in the long run, and hence worth buying, has more to do with better balance between sillyness and RNG.

"Real quick no bullshit:
Buy if
-You like chaotic fun
-Playing with friend group
-Enjoy griefing other players

Don't Buy if
-You don't like elements of luck
-Hackers piss you off
-You can't stand repetitive content

The long take:
So after playing for a decent number of hours, winning a couple of times, and playing all the minigames at least once, I can't really recommend it. At the end of the day, Fall Guys isn't a very good video game. It's repetitive, shallow, and full of problems that the devs simply aren't incentivized to fix. The playerbase is pretty low skill now, because of people mass buying the game after watching a streamer play it. These criticisms come from an honest place of love, because the concept is pretty neat. Unfortunately, the devs are probably too small scale to handle the issues that come from such a large playerbase effectively.

The game has hackers without any real countermeasures constantly cheating in games, weird latency issues, input delay for some people, on some games, sometimes. Up until last patch it had uneven team games to complain about, but they fixed that by stopping you from getting sent to team games with uneven teams. The problem being, this lowered the effective pool of games even more, so I hope you like playing the same 6 two minute games over and over again for the first couple of rounds.

And you will be playing the first couple of rounds a lot regardless of skill level I'm afraid, because the games that tend to make up the middle section of every episode often have heavy elements of luck. Honestly a lot of them do. Doesn't matter if you can win final showdowns or not, you will be stuck playing pick random door and baby's first mario level race over and over again. Oh also, sometimes you will just lose because the swarm tramples you to death, or physically blocks you from moving. It's amusing the first couple of times, but loses it's appeal over time. 

People can grab you, starting fights, and although this is way more fun than actually playing the game, you are probably just lowering both of your chances of winning by doing it due to the unpredictable vagaries of lag. It's really funny though, so if you do buy the game, please try to throw everyone off the level whenever you can.

Let's take a look at a selection of games, since people will tell you that Fall Guys may have flaws, but the games are good. I will admit that some of them are pretty fast paced and fun, others not so much.

Egg Scramble- 3 way team game where 2 teams gang up on the team in last place, which they can do nothing about, because the two teams ahead of them win if they lose. The timer is bafflingly not 10 seconds long, which is how long it actually takes to decide the match. I suggest checking your phone after yellow team has 0 points left to pass the time.

Perfect Match- Memory game so easy, it is common to see literally nobody get eliminated from it. Boring, way too long.

Tail Tag- Everyone has a tail, grab players to take their tail. Timer is again too long, only matters if you have a tail at the end so the first minute is pointless. Bonus points for being able to grab other players without taking their tail, while they can grab your tail with their psychic powers from across the map.

Team Tail Tag- See above, with the addition of being almost unable to contribute to the match at all after you get a tail.

Roll Out- Everyone is on a rotating cylinder, split into sections with some gaps. 10 people who should not be playing any video game will fall in immediately, leaving everyone to awkwardly grab each other, because it simply doesn't roll fast enough to knock 15 people off. Eventually, mercifully, some guy wearing a scout costume will pick a fight with a chicken man, killing them both so the round can actually end.

Royal Fumble- Tail Tag but in the final round, just to make sure that you can't get crowns consistently.

Slime Climb- Actually fun. Everyone is trying to grief you, don't panic and simply avoid them, or make it your mission to become Anti Bully Ranger by defending the weak they prey on. Everyone who grabs me at the end must go in the slime or I am not crossing that finish line.

Fall Ball- Fall Ball kicks ass. Play volleyball disguised as soccer, grab other players, bounce the ball off of your head, but don't have a bad connection, or else!

In the end, if you don't mind playing the same very short games over and over, with little control over if you actually win or lose episodes, then you will probably like this game. Beans fly everywhere which is kinda funny. But it got stale for me after a while, and I don't think a handful of new games coming out in a month will really change my opinion much. Even if you aren't a sweaty tryhard, some of the games just aren't fun, or have issues that ruin them. There is a pervasive design philosophy of wasting your time, so please buy the game if you are looking to do that.

As a final note, I peck typed this entire review between matches, always make sure to check if your region has massive waiting times to get into games before you buy.",False

The only problem with the game so far is the recent income of hackers that just come and ruin your rounds, but I have faith that the developers will do something about it.

"+ The events are mostly well designed and fun
+ Addictive replayability trying to someday be #1

- Not enough events. Even as a new player, after a few games you will be repeating events, after about 10 games you will have experienced everything this game has to offer.
- Starts to feel a bit repetitive after about 1 hour

Overall, is it fun? Yes, for a limited short time. With the current amount of content available within Fall Guys, I would have priced this game at around $5 but no more than $10.. If they decide to add (A LOT) more content later on, than perhaps this game is justifiable at $20, but currently I wouldn't imagine playing Fall Guys for more than 30 minutes..

Let alone five. If they fix the servers then it might be worth it, but as of right now, no. They have hackers everywhere, but they ""say"" that if someone sees a hacker then their banned right afterwards. I'm not sure I believe that considering there are still so many hackers. The levels are all the same, and the team games and the tail grab game is by far the worst thing I've ever seen in a game. For the team games it's all luck since most people get disconnected or you end up with one person less than your opponents, making the team games more luck based then anything. Tail grab is by far the worst game mode in any game period. it doesn't keep track of how long you had the tail so it's better to just not move for a minute and then grab a tail for the last 15-30 seconds, that's not fun, that's a bad game mode. But of course that is assuming you even get to those game modes, because odds are your gonna disconnect after a round or two. If you go to the actual game page on their website it says they're fixing it and to wait an hour or two and try again. But I hear you say ""What if I only could play for an hour or two?"" Well your screwed then because you really can't do anything. I also hear you thinking though ""I can wait an hour or two, but it kept disconnecting me again? Now what?"" Well according to the Developers, you get another 1-2 hour wait! Yay you! All the other game modes are good enough though and it is a fun game. If they fix all the problems then it'll be a great game, if not then it will continue to be trash.",False

"Fix the hacking problem, add some more mini-games, and this is a fantastic game.

While more mini-games would help keep my attention for longer, the hacking problem alone is enough for me to warn others to not purchase until remedied. The game was a blast until this become progressively worse. Adding fuel to the fire, the developers actively ask you NOT to report hackers and insist their anti-hacking technology solves the problem - which it does not. Because of this, they have prevented any way of reporting these issues to them or even specific players found hacking.

All-in-all, the game is fun but they've got to get the hacking under control. It ruins the game.

Don't purchase until this has been solved.",False

"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is another one of those ""didn't I play this this as a custom TF2/GMod mode back in the day?"" games, which really seem to be a smash hit nowadays. Deservedly so, it's well polished and has a simple but well executed cosmetic progression system to give you that little hit of dopamine that comes with acquiring a new costume. You move from mini-game to mini-game, with the pool of competition decreasing every round until you win or are eliminated. It makes for a fun gameplay loop that can become quite addictive. Unfortunately not all mini-games are created equal. There are a few less enjoyable ones and a few that seem to show up far too frequently. Replayability is the main concern for a game like this and the current pool of mini-games is noticeably limited, but I'll reserve my judgement until we see where the developers take the game in the coming months or years. [b]Regardless of some occasionally repetitive gameplay, Fall Guys is wildly enjoyable with a few friends and the low barrier to entry makes for an excellent party game. This is a great pickup to add to your group's nightly game rotation.[/b]",True
The game still has a lot of bugs. Youll get stuck on the qualifying screen fairly often. Your lobby will sometimes join a game and you wont. The lag is a serious problem especially with tag events.

"Fall Guys Is A $30 Online Only Game Plagued With Hackers, The Game Has An Unreliable Anti-Cheat And Only 'Works' After The Game Ends, If They've Been Detected By It... Which Rarely Happens. The Game Also Loves To Constantly Select Team Based Game Modes Which Force You To Rely On Mostly Incapable Teammates Who Are Either AFK Or Twiddling Their Thumbs In A Corner. Lastly The Most Outrages Flaw In My Opinion Are Micro-Transactions Which I Believe Have No Place In A $30 Game. (I'm Aware There Cosmetic Only, But Still A Little Ridiculous) Despite This, The Game Has A Great Concept And Brings A Fresh Idea To The Battle Royal Genre, But Is Unfortunately Set Back By These Glaring Flaws. At This point In Time The Negatives Severely Outweigh The Positives. However, If You're On The Fence About Purchasing Fall Guys, I'd Recommend Waiting For Either A Sale Or A Massive Bug Fix. 

TLDR: Game Is Pretty Expensive For What It Offers, And Is Riddled With Game Breaking Bugs, Cheaters And Micro-Transactions. I'd Personally Recommend Waiting For Either A Sale Or Patch.",False

"After seeing a few of the videos, the art style had turned me off as well as people branding it with the term “Battle Royale” I planned on just avoiding this title. It seemed a bit too bright and well, honestly everyone has been throwing BR’s without any thought at the wall to see what sticks.  I finally ended up giving it a try.  
One of the key things about this game that nobody is talking about is it performs like a platformer, the kind we had when the N64 first came out with that nice transition for most of the Nintendo titles at least going from 2d to 3d.  It does take skill to get through the game and it’s not like some of the indie games out there where you have only pseudo control of your character.  If you like the challenge of platformers, give this a try.  The environment with the ‘beans’ being your characters and bright colors actually is tastefully done, when playing you’ll notice small shadings and details where everything isn’t just a layout of boxes to save on the poly counts.
There is an element of RNG to the game, but most of that comes with the players and most obstacles can be avoided or timed to give you the best speed run winning the race, when it’s a race.  Most videos I saw were of 1 or 2 race type maps, but there are team games in the tournament as well as a memory type game.  
The Sounds in the game are spot on and so is the soundtrack. I was pleasantly surprised by this as it as it ties in the whole package of the games experience.  It’s a solid game and most importantly it is actually really fun and with that while you may rage out or go on tilt, you only seem to go on about it until the next match starts. The atmosphere the game creates is Fun first and then Competitive which allows you to grind out multiple matches chasing that ever elusive crown at the end like it’s nothing and never wearing you out. 
Finally, this game supports M&K + Controllers, but this is one of those rare instances that I’m going to tell you to take the controller route.

"I have played 45 hours+ and won 40+ crowns so far. Its absolutely a good for fun/competitive game, so enjoyable at first, but the gaming experience is literally getting ruined by the hackers (no matter speed boosts or fly hacks) recently. Its so annoying to queue and play with hackers 18 games in a row. Its only  2-3 seconds when the game starts, I can already see 1,2 players are already qualified. For sure they are that good arent they uh? And meanwhile the server is completely garbage, every 4 to 5 games you get disconnected legit for no reason. Imagine you are heading to final and the system shows you are disconnected how tilted you can be. Just watched a clip and realized season 2 is coming. To be honest I am really excited and looking forward to it but please, fix your game. Ban all the hackers before you actually release season 2. I have reported more than 50 players using hacks in game via the official Fall Guys page. But still I havent received any feedback they just kept saying 'we are reviewing your case'. One last thing is I am pretty sure the new hacks can now change their Fall Guy ID, i mean like Fall Guy (xxxx). Coz most of the hackers recently are having Fall Guy 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444, 5555, 6666... in these two days. So it is pointless even if i send a screenshot to the Fall Guy Team and report the fake in game id. This game deserves a better community and gaming experience to all the normal players. So please update your anti cheat system, thank you.",False

"I can't recommend this as a fun party game. 

For folks who want to win party games - don't bother. You can make it to the very end of the rounds and get a race event where you literally start behind everyone else. What a fun race to the finish, just hoping they all make a mistake and you don't cause that is your only hope. Or a team event knocks you out cause you are down a man from that start or your team just stinks. This doesn't even touch on folks who are cheating - I hadn't seen any but I have only played 3 hours, but plenty of reviews and the Dev team has acknowledged the cheating.

For folks who play these for the laughs - There is so much downtime. I spent about the same time in the menu/loading screens as I did in events and that's for games where I make it to the very last round. So much. And the competitive folks who will put up with the randomness will beat you - they know the routes, they play all day.


For everyone - the number of events is small and some just aren't fun. They just are boring. 30 seconds of 'that wasn't very exciting' and that counts when you win. Match the tile? Races where you start in the back row? It just feels bad.

This coupled with the emphasis on the store makes it feel even worse that the gameplay parts are lacking.


It's just not good enough right now.

If you don't care about the randomness, don't get bored of the few events there are(really not that many and some are SOOOO boring - match the tiles? Come on.) and don't mind having a second monitor and needing something up, give it a try. Please watch your hours, you may want to return it before the 2 hour mark.

"Neat game but needs a lot of work.

The environments aren't that interesting and nothing really seems to fit. The game has a brightly coloured cartoon aesthetic but no real style, everything seems mashed together and placed without real integration into the world. The stages seem more like low effort player made levels than properly designed courses.

The gameplay is all quite samey, but entertaining enough. The tail tag modes are very frustrating because of the heavy desync in player positions. The rest are fine but all lack variation within themselves. There's only one Egg Scramble level, one Fall Ball pitch, etc. The race modes have the most variation, and focus on their own gimmicks. I'd appreciate it if these could be expanded on more, with a few different layouts with each gimmick. Maybe even a combination of gimmicks!
The other game modes certainly need a lot more variation. It gets pretty boring to play the same game mode on the same map over and over again.

The customisation is pretty standard. You can combine different clothes on the top and bottom of your body along with body paint, paint colours, faces, and face colours. There are also some different emotes.
Obtaining new items takes a little while, likely because the game sells the currency used as microtransactions. This is pretty disappointing to see in a premium game. Most of the customisation options are nondescript, and the lack of colour options for clothing is a little frustrating. It feels like the emphasis is on getting new outfits, rather than making a character from what you have. This is reinforced by the timed shop, as it pressures you to buy entire outfits quickly rather than miss out on half. Showing off an outfit you've bought is certainly preferred over mixing and matching what you have.

Overall, you could do a lot worse for your money, but you could also do so much better.",True

If you do, just quit the show, there's no point.

All that being said, it's addicting as hell and fun to play with friends.",True
"Very funny game! Reminds me of game shows like Takeshi's castle which I fondly remember. Gameplay is super addicting and many of the stages are fun, although a few minigames need tweaking. I barely see cheaters but they are a problem, luckily the developers are currently looking for a permanent solution to the cheats. I think the game has a lot of potential but that hasn't stopped a large wave of [strike]redditards[/strike] reddit and twitter users whining about every last aspect of the game. I can see the game living for at least another few years, provided that the developers don't make any bad decisions. 9/10 game, extremely fun but can be equally frustrating occasionally. Worth the $20 dollar price tag!

UPDATE: After a few week have gone by, I have decided to change my review. The developers clearly don't care about banning cheaters and none of the bugs have been patched. Pathetic cash grab, game might be worth purchasing on sale but I highly regret paying 20 USD.

Honestly this would be a fun game if it weren't for their god awful cheat protection. Better yet I don't believe they have any kind of protection. The fact that a hacker can win the final level in 2 seconds and the game doesn't have software to detect that really reflects poorly on the developers. It seems there isn't a single game without at least one hacker in it these days making it completely unplayable. One would assume by now they would of implemented a report system at the very least or addressed the issue at hand.

NO MATTER my performance in the first two rounds, I always get stuck with a horrible team in the second or third round, basically ending my chances of winning there and making my first two rounds worthless. Whether its a team trapping my ball in the corner on the hill map or just having a bad team in general, a game where you win AS A SOLO should not randomly leave your chances of winning up to 10 other players.

"The Falling Bean game is a really good bean simulator.

With the quirky nature of the concept that pits beans against other beans, in an all out race (or fall to the death) to be the #1 bean.

In terms of gameplay and issues, there can be instances where it seems you shouldn't have fallen or gotten knocked over, or maybe someone grabbed you even though it looks like you're far enough away for it to not be possible, and or in some rare cases, it seems you can even fail to grab the Crown in a certain stage even if you do see your character grabbing it, causing you to lose.

The current map pool is pretty decent, however, it'll only take you maybe 20~ games at max before you see every stage at least once, and some far more than others. I'd like to hopefully see at least double the current map pool within a year~ given the current popularity. 
Further, there are a couple ""modes"" which are seemingly too easy for most people, and don't really give a challenge (Main offender being the matching mode as you can just follow the crowd), and personally, the teamwork modes are interesting, but can certainly just ruin your possible win streak or just chance of winning, since you have to rely on others to not make mistakes or miss the goal.

The soundtrack is somewhat catchy, however, it isn't something I'd personally listen to casually if given the choice.

The current monetization method is pretty good, giving users a choice to purchase the basic currency (which isn't hard to obtain with normal play), while also not allowing users to purchase the ""Crowns,"" used to buy the most sought after cosmetics in the Legendary category, which can only be obtained by winning a full tournament. 
However, I do find the current shop system to be a bit bland and lackluster, forcing users to have to check back every day for a new item rotation as well as only showing a handful of options, and unless you're in the loop, you may miss a limited-time legendary cosmetic set (or other item) offer, which may never return, so I feel that they could announce limited-time items better, and give users more access to the available items that can be purchased without needing to wait for a rotation. 

Note: With the update on 9/15/2020, Easy Anti-Cheat was implemented, I will assume that this will further reduce most chances of you spotting a cheater in your game. As such, I don't believe cheating is no longer a notable issue at the moment.

Overall, if you've got the 20$ to spare, or can get the game on sale, I do recommend Falling Beans, although in its current state it may still feel a bit empty, but it will hopefully grow to lose that.",True
"It is a decent game don't get me wrong but it does get very repetitive very quickly and is very buggy at times. But other than that, if you know your friends are also interested/ own it, it is a must buy.",True
"Almost Wii sports like, and the game lets you grief without being excessive. Also there are plenty of skin options without having to pay a buttload of cash to be like everyone else. You can any skin you want just by playing the game. There are a few modes where a team you get assigned can screw you over but that is pretty much any team-comp game rn. You can have a team up to 4 people, when you play a mode where you need to have a team your group members will automatically be on your team which is sweet. Overall a real fun game, Nintendo+Wipeout like.",True

"This game could have been a wonderful, entertaining game for friends and family...if only it weren't for a few things that personally ruined my experience with Fall Guys.

CONS:

- Team levels are unfair as you get eliminated with the rest of the team even if you do your part and the other team members don't. So you're basically winning by luck and not skill. Occasional trolls here and there during team rounds.
- Trolls stand at the finish line and push people off the platform, making the game less fun to play as you can't even report the trolls. They just get to ruin everyone's fun with no consequence. They should remove the ability to use the grab button at the finish line.
- Grabbing option should be removed or adjusted to better suit rollback net code and only be available to use during levels where it's necessary (tails level, soccer).

With these issues being fixed, the game would be a great option to play for those interested in competitive gaming and online multiplayer (even with family and friends).

PROS:

- Character customization is fun and offers a lot of skin colors/clothing/shop items to choose and purchase from
- You can play with people around the world easily so this makes Fall Guys an optimal game to play with loved ones
- A wide variety of randomly chosen level categories to play from, ranging from Survival, Race, and Team levels.

 Fall Guys has the potential to be the wholesome online party game we have always wanted, but that's only if they fix the issues that only allow for trolls to safely ruin the experience for everyone else.",False

"Fall Guys is a simple Battle Royale, where 60 players compete in a variety of mini-games. Some reviews talk about how there are cheaters and poor server management, but I haven't found either of those to be prevalent problems.

"It's Raving Rabbids meets Super Meat boy. So much anger and so much hate for a game that brings so much joy when you win!

Couple of suggestions for the developers (if anyone reads these):
1) a report system for hacking or sabotaging the game (i.e if they dont think they will win, they grab onto you so you can't win either. Happened a few times in Fall Mountain)
2a) Add a new gamemode every 2 weeks a remove 1 gamemode from the game. After you've made around 20 games just cycle in 8 random modes each week to keep the game feeling fresh (always keep all final modes and add 1 every 8 weeks)
2b) Add a suggestion forum for people to add their ideas for games. They can add photos of drawings as well to help illustrate their idea.
3)A Stats menu showing: Wins - Average position finished per game and per round - total grabs - total times being grabbed - highest win rate gamemode - lowest winrate gamemode - highest winrate colour - lowest winrate colour - favourite cosmetics (most times used) - total kudos earned - number of times you've finished a game first - number of times you've lost on the first game - number of times you've reached the showdown. Possibilities are endless but stat trackers are great for people to flex
4) Allow people to use gestures in the game when its counting down 3...2...1...

"I wouldn’t call it a bad game, but it’s not the game for me. For $30, I don’t recommend the game right now with the lack of content and early issues which have not been addressed.

In the short period of time I’ve played this game, I already feel dreadful playing the same maps over and over again. A lot of these game modes involve running from one end of the map to the other before other players can and some of them are just completely unfair to play. Team games like “Soccer” are a prime example, where a team or two will be a player down since the remaining players can’t be equally distributed. A simple fix would be to remove these games from the pool for the round. Aside from that, tail grabbing modes are by far my least favourite as they are simply frustrating, often I will grab a player from behind but won’t get the tail and other times my tail gets stolen from far away. Either way, it’s definitely a turn off to be eliminated due to game interactive or server side issues which have existed since launch.

This is more personal but I personally don’t enjoy the chaotic nature of the game nor RNG elements. Bumping into players especially in the early rounds was absolutely frying my mind as I had barely any control over my character and there was no counter play… Just helpless as I get thrown around randomly. Though, looking from another perspective, I can see why these interactions would be hilarious or cute especially with friends and they might enjoy that aspect instead. However, I’m semi-competitive and prefer to perform at least decently in whatever games I play, so there’s a limit to how much wackiness I can handle.

Regarding longevity of the game, RNG elements will eventually get the better of “try hard” players since the skill ceiling has dropped so low by accommodating for newer players to enjoy a leveled playing field. Even if RNG elements were to be removed, casual players usually aren’t dedicated to a game in particular and enjoy the moment while it lasts.  Although, I think the game could last a couple months with innovative ideas but its popularity will definitely take a big hit soon, repetitiveness is a core issue in this game and party games in general. I could probably last another hour or two before I’m completely done but might occasionally comeback to the game if playing with friends.

"First off this game involves rounds of minigames that eliminate players as they go on, eventually a ""Final minigame"" happens that decides the winner of the show. I love playing it, especially after I make it to the later rounds but it has its issues. First of all the team games are terrible, they rely too much on teamwork and if you get stuck with a few new players it causes even the most seasoned player to be eliminated. I feel like having seperate modes for team mini-games would improve the user experience especially because you can party up with people and it doesn't do much good when you're competing against each other! Second problem is the physics, I am all for the funny physics but sometimes its super annoying, lets say your getting close to the end of a course and then you slip and a stampede of people plow over you and your instantly eliminated, bad right? Sadly that happens to often for me to appreciate the quirky physics. Last problem is! The price, I feel this game should be 5 bucks at max but really... should be free, for 20 dollars your not getting a full game, your getting a fun Battle Royale thats so new it doesn't have any modes! Just know that when purchasing your not getting this fully-kitted and worked out game. And who knows, the devs might leave this game as-is and not add anything to match its price, only time will tell. But overall the game is so fun and easy to play straight after purchase.

"This game has potential, and my review could change over time. Right now there is just too little variety to make this game worth the price. The actual gameplay is fairly monotonous and there really are not very many different activities available. The character customization is also much more limited than suggested. Playing with friends isn't great right now because there is no shortcut to spectate friends and instead you have to painfully cycle through as many as 60 other players.

Pros:
- Sometimes funny
- Low-effort/relaxing gameplay
- Fun with lots of friends?

Cons:
- Lackluster repetitive gameplay
- Poor character customization and heavily monetized
- Limited character movement control
- Total load times roughly equal to play time
- No prioritization for spectating friends
- Many other party games better than this

so fun,True
"Okay imma make it fairly simple and easy to understand, the game itself is a masterpiece! I enjoy every minute of the game but I feel there's more down's then up's to this game.

The game is well made and is very enjoyable for everyone looking for a party game, on the other hand i believe that people have been taking this game way over the top and take this as a E-sports game and give in too much time into the game. you're always playing with at least 10-20 people who are crazy good at the game, 1-5 hackers, and the rest are just people trying to enjoy their time which is ruined because some fat 12 year old saw a video on how to beat every map as fast as possible and beat the game in a second.

Secondly, servers are just such a joke at first you might start a game and crash because of disconnections to the server and sometimes your rewards might not show up after finishing a game, sometimes someone glitches through the barriers and such and sometimes it just doesn't work properly and makes you lose the round.

And lastly!
the maps... I love all the survival, race and solo maps which you have to beat on your own and not rely on teammates, but every time I see that I'm joining the game and its egg scramble, football (soccer), team tail tag, jinxed and the list goes on, i might aswell just leave the game because some people just cant play the game properly as a group and lose you your chance to win it all.

In conclusion, fall guys is seriously great and I enjoy playing it with friends and alone from time to time...
but the game just has downsides that are greater then upsides, The game is entering a state like fortnite in season 4 where people are becoming too much of tryhards and the games fun level is dropping because of that.
I hope that some of the next updates and patches to help reduce or remove these problems. (Add ranked matchmaking for the tryhards, add map selections for the maps you actually wanna play, and just improve the servers.)

Hope you guys find this review assisting in some type of way, and if you do buy the game I hope your experience will be better then mine with the game.",False

Played around 7/8 matches.
-Got disconnected twice before going into the last round.
-The last round I actually got to play was Hex-A-Gone, and to my disbelief I already had found a cheater that everytime he was about to fall into the slime he just launched himself up to the topmost available tile, like he was in some sort of upwards wind torrent.

.... and of course there is no ingame option to report a person, neither you can track that person down on steam, and manually report him through his profile. 
Whatever anti cheat system the Devs implemented I doubt its effectiveness.

Cheaters in a competitive game = deal breaker",False

"I'll be the first to admit, when I saw this game, my first impression was that it looked cute, but probably a game that would quickly feel dry. Something to play when you were bored to pass the time. But, the more I watched, the more I saw many many people playing. And I thought, well, there must be something more to it if streamers are playing in 6+ hour stints. So, after a bit of consideration, I decided to buy it.

I was very pleasantly surprised. The game exudes so much charm, and it's definitely more challenging than it looks - though not to the point of annoyance. A really great party game with a bright and appealing environment and characters/outfits. The music is great too.

I hope to see this game retain its popularity for a long time to come!",True

After 34 hours of playtime this game is extremely fun! The only games I cant stand are tail based games. If you dont want to rage I would recommend playing with at least 3 people.

"This is a game I am surprised didn't happen sooner. The closest game I could compare it to would be Dorito's Crash Course on the Xbox 360, but that was limited to 4 players. The Takeshi's Castle / Total Wipeout formula works great as a battle royale, and is immensely fun. There is a nice variety of round types but all are not created equal. Team games can be a slap in the face if you get unlucky with teammates, and I have yet to see more than 3 people die to Match Perfect. A few games probably need some tweaks, but the overall experience is fun. 8/10",True

"I have played this game for about 8 hours and it is a pure blast. It can be really funny to see all of these little jelly beans bouncing around. My dad was happy that I got this game because it had no violence unlike many battle royals, but despite it being very kid-friendly, the games are still action packed and tense ( in a good way! ). I have a low performance laptop that isn't meant for gaming but it still runs very well and I can barely tell the difference in terms of graphics. The game doesn't try to sell you any of their currency in your face ( although that is an option to buy outfits for your character ), instead you are rewarded based on how well you do in the game. You will be frustrated/happy while playing this game, but you will be laughing along the way no matter what. Overall I give this game a 9/10. Very worth the $20! Enjoy the game!",True

"This game has issues and i will get to that but it is a prime example of why we need competition and diversity in the gaming industry. For example Nintendo keeps remaking the same stuff its been banking on since 1995 and one tiny Dev makes this fantastic sensation that probably sold more copies in the first 2 weeks then mario galaxy ever did. I could say this is the new Fortnite and i may indeed be right. I dont like the name because women play this game,women exist,we play and stream games and its not 1990,no im not a guy. That aside,this game is super fun,its competitive yet goofy,its adorable yet anger inducing,its bright and colorful and appeals to kids and adults but makes you feel awful for thinking that neon orange dino skin is dope... This game is basically highs and lows the game.the skins are fantastic,the characters are cute and well designed yet so simple. the soundtrack has some real bangers and suits the game perfectly! You earn coins by playing and the better you do the more you get,which is very fair. It needs some fixes with the servers but considering this ISNT a major developer im really impressed. I cant imagine how difficult it must be to set up and maintain a server list with so many players. Some of the games need balancing,like the tail tag should be who has it the longest not the last. The balls of the soccer one should drop in random places so people cant predict and sit in one spot to get shots on goal. There should be a timer for the finish lines once a certain number of people have crossed,to stop trolls and idiots from standing there taunting. Hackers..really? Hacking in falls guys has to be the lamest thing ever, but really the devs need to get on their security to stop that sh*t. I cant wait to see how this game evolves and gets better as time goes on. Pro League Fall Guys on Twitch? Sign me up!",True
"It's really fun and addicting the only bad thing is exploiters ruining it a bit, also sometimes it's hard to get in a game to play.",True
"i was just a young lad here in Scotland, the year 1987. As I grew up, I became interested in graphical design and aviation. Once I turned 18, I went to study in the UK at Cambridge, dual majoring in physics and graphical design. After completing my term at university, I moved to California, USA, to begin a career in video game design. Over the next 7 years, we would release indie games here and there, you may have heard of a few like Escape from Detroit, Falling Men, full-life ,and Strike: Local Defensive. We went on to become very wealthy and I bought a swanky apartment in Silicon Valley. I was once throwing a launch party at my apartment with some friends to celebrate our recent release, when I met this beautiful Spanish woman there named Nero. We hit it off and got married a year ago. Just recently I was playing this game and she playfully turned off my PC and suggested we have some fun. I shot her repeatedly. Nobody interrupts my Fall Guys. 4/5 would recommend.",True

Not the mention how unstable the servers are. I play with a group of friends and we are constantly being disconnected, its not a big deal if its on the first round, but when you make it to the final and get instantly disconnected its so painful.

Honestly ive got PTSD from playing this. 3 hours ill never get back. never been worth 16 quid. Avoid at all cost. This is litterally the first time ive ever reviewed anything on steam and i had to make the exception as I can't sit here and allow my fellow man to go through what I've just gone through.

It brings me back to simpler times when my family was still whole and not scattered across the country like someone's ashes. We would sit together and watch Wipe Out. My father would joke ""If i was there, i could easily win"". This triggered my mother's competitive personality and lo and behold, next morning, in my yard there was a make-shift Wipeout course. Well one broken hip later, my father refused to speak to me for some reason even though i had nothing to do with orchestrating the events and I have yet to speak to him for five years.

"Pros:
• Fun and chill mini-games.
• The game design is great and the soundtrack is nice.
• Matchmaking is quick, for finding 60 players that's nice.
• Requires some skill and logic.

Neutral:
• Micro-transactions on a $20 game, why?

Cons:
• This a $20 MINI-game, not a game.
• Therefore, it is too expensive. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this.
• Highly based on luck, sadly.
• Highly repetitive.
• Lacks a workshop for community content.
• Lacks private games with friends.

In my opinion, [b]this game should not exist at this price as a standalone[/b].
This is like a game mode in Garry's Mod or Tower Unite.

Maybe some of these problems might be addressed in later updates but for now, i wouldn't recommend this game. Especially as it is supposed to be a finished game, and not an Early-Access game.",False

"It's not a game you should play to relax. It's frustrating when you can't get control of your character for a few seconds because everyone walks over you and before you know it, you've lost the round. The team based rounds are too random and very often there isn't much you can do if others leave early, stay inactive, or troll. It is fairy enjoyable with a larger group of friends, but not for couples (it's frustrating to be waiting alone for the other to finish their match). Also, I don't like that you can't leave when another round is loading if you miss the window of opportunity between the rounds (sometimes even 20s of a time loss). I like the graphics and the idea, but there are some bugs and features that need polishing. Overall 6.5/10, but not for everyone, and definitely not for me. Suitable for parties - but then again, everyone needs their own copy to join, which probably isn't ideal.",False

Not only has your support been unhelpful, but it has LITERALLY MADE IT WORSE. IN 7 DAYS I HAVE GOTTEN 1 REPLY DESPITE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT A SUPPORT TEAM. I find it really unfortunate because I actually really enjoy the game **When I can play it** but it's gotten to the point where the support I expected to get, knowing that there are a lot of cases that are ongoing right now, I at least expected for some sort of mass message but the cutesie bull shit of ""To many Jellybeans in the jar"" is tiring, because even with that being the case, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT IS MY F###ING PROBLEM, Please, Advise, Refund, or fix, I am tired of this crap.

"Poor character handling leads to frustration. You can fall for no reason after jumping which makes last round mistakes a losing one.

Sure it's fun to play at first but it's already lost novelty after just a few hours. A couple of things I would like to see is better control over the character, as it is right now it's like QWOP sometimes and the ball physics seems off due to being multi-hit on screen and not going the right direction when hit. It is fun but it can be BS and it needs some rework until it plays better.",False

"Indie developer MediaTonic is unable to work fast enough to accommodate the explosive popularity of it’s latest game Fall Guys. This game being one of the very few games (7 of 118) they have created for home consoles, the launch was a disaster. The servers could not hold up to the demand. You cannot fault them as with many hit games on launch day, they suffer from overloaded servers. The real problem here is the game released with alpha-like issues. Players had the ability to change their usernames to anything they wanted with just basic understanding of HTML. Usernames taking up the entire screens, profanity, colour changes etc. plagued game lobbies. Also, players quickly found out the game could be hacked using the most basic of cheating software, Cheat Engine. Add insult to injury, there was no anti-cheat systems present to stop such behaviour. This made the game unplayable for those playing honestly. Hackers were able to increase their player’s speed and fly around the course with ease. The barrier to entry was none existence being this cheating software was FREE to download and is as easy as clicking one button to enable a speed hack. As honest players were left helplessly losing in frustration, they may have also turned to using the cheat software to level the playing field. MediaTonic’s solution was to disable usernames and enable an automated anti-cheat system that would flag cheating players from connecting to their servers. On August 10th anti-cheat had sent a massive banwave across their player base. Players quickly found them “falling” for hours and hours unable to connect to any games. MediaTonic took down communication on their Discord and left their support email system to handle the grunt of the complaints. The support emails were automated replies and explained to just check their twitter, wait until it works again, or restart your game. Many players tried such advice while accumulating hours of play time just in waiting for a game to start. Underhandedly MediaTonic left players with no clear answer if they banned and had them surpass 2 in-game hours to stop Steam from issuing refunds. If you unaware of Steam’s refund policy, it states you must meet these two criteria. 2 hours or less of in-game playing time and less then 14 days of game ownership.

August 20th 2020, the CM from MediaTonic, has officially stated anyone falling forever during a solo game, but can join friends games, has been flagged aka banned. She states this is a PERMANENT ban and you will not be able to appeal. It appears MediaTonic has done an amazing job of robbing their community. A solution to the problem would be to introduce a 2 or 3 strike policy, or just reset players progress with a zero-tolerance policy thereafter. It appears this is not interest of MediaTonic as they already have your money and are hoping for players to re-purchase the game. I don’t expect any change from this UK based developer in the future, but time will tell.

August 25th 2020, MediaTonic decided to remove Family Sharing to combat against hackers. This decision left honest customers upset they can no longer let their spouse or children play the game too. Conveniently enough, this forces these customers to buy the game again. Another great way to double up their sales. This $20usd game is quickly becoming a $40usd game and thats not including collector’s edition, DLC and In-game currency purchases which don’t transfer over to the family shared users. Hackers are still rampant in games even after this tactic. The real solution to this problem is improving cheat detection, not shutting down accounts. There are communities devoted to hacking and they aren’t stopping even it costs them $20 for another chance to try their hacks.",False

"The concept of a battle royale of 60 players is quite chaotic in a positive way. It is not uncommon for us to bump into each other as a result of scrambling to enter the door or avoiding obstacles that come.

I have a toaster of a laptop and live in Brazil, and so far have no big issues with Frame rate or high ping.",True
"The game is pretty fun, it definitely scratches the same itch that the Mario Party or Wii Party games do, without needing a Nintendo Console (or friends at your place, lol). For me, the running speed and jumping span was weird at the beginning and something I really needed to get used to; the jump has barely any forward movement, which makes you miscalculate a ton of jumps in the first hour of playing. 

The game can be pretty tough in the beginning but is also heavily influenced by luck or the behavior of other people, which isn't a negative thing, just something people should know. The failure of others can cause your own elimination pretty quickly not only in team games, but also when others repeatedly fling you away or cause you to fall, haha. So if you're a control freak that wants to develop impeccable skill and be rewarded, this is probably not the game for you, because this is less about your own skill and more about getting through the frenzy with any means necessary, and having your perfect run ruined by things you can absolutely not control. Be ready to scream.

My criticism so far is that the maps of the first 2 rounds are always the same ones. The more interesting ones that have more to do with your skills or have well-thought out concepts come later on at the 3rd and after. As a beginner (Lvl 1-8) you might not make it past the first or second round for a looong time or at least multiple times in a row, which means you will get absolutely sick of the Seesaw, Hit Parade and Whirly Gig Maps. It cannot be bad luck on my end that these 3 are the only round 1-2 maps I ever get. My point is, having more variety in the first two rounds' maps would be amazing, because as a person just getting into playing it, it gets old really fast. 
Also, more music. The same tune with the same 2-3 maps in a row for 30 minutes is psychological torture.

EVERY SINGLE LOBBY you enter has a hacker in it, they can detect which obstacles are fake, they have max collision, they can jump on tiles they have already been removed and they can run much quicker then you can. It doesn't mean they're guarantee a win, but they will almost always qualify to the end. also they don't have an anti cheat from what I've seen, they don't even have a reporting system so you can report the fucking cheaters... they need custom games and map making, not including that is just pure lazy. The biggest issues the game has at the moment though is their custom games, and not being able to avoid players so they wont ever be on your team again.

"I've clocked 50 hours in about 5 days, and i'm not ashamed of it at all. 

I was very hesitant to purchase the game at first, and I didn't even know about it until the day before I did. I must admit, it is one of the most fun and rewarding games I have ever played. Usually with a lot of new releases I am following the games socials anticipating its release, sitting there with a big smile and my Pre-order bonus code. Only for it to be a gigantic flop and passed onto the history books in the first week. It seems that when I find a game out of the blue with no knowledge and take a jump into the deep end with a gambled purchase, I actually seem to enjoy it.
Let me share some thoughts to help with your decision: 

Positives - 

- Winning gives such a large amount of satisfaction due to the reward involved, there are cosmetic items on a daily and 72 hour rotation, which can be bought with Crowns and Kudos (The 2 in game currencies) with the better items costing Crowns instead of Kudos. These Kudos can be purchased for real money or earned from playing games. Whereas the Crowns can only be obtained from winning games or the 3 received from the free pass every 60 days, AND NO OTHER WAY. This gives an insane amount of achievement as there is something that you can be work towards that you know people cannot cheat or buy their way to.

 - An addition to the one above, Winning games is also a big achievement, as unlike other recent Battle Royales, it is not easy to win by using the 'meta' and skill. A brand new player could win on their first game. No problem. Yeah sure, you do learn the routes and get better the more you play. But a lot of game modes are RNG based.

- It doesn't get repetitive, not for me anyway. This was a big reason of why i was hesitant with my purchase. I thought to myself 'this will get extremely repetitive very fast, playing the same maps and modes over and over for hours on end' But it simply doesn't. The excitement of getting more and more crowns until no more can fit on my head is so enticing it just makes me keep coming back. And as a completionist i love trying to complete every last one of the steam achievements, which with 50 hours, i still have around 5 to go. 

- The developers are listening. I am so glad that the developers are listening to the community through their discord server, they have a channel that they open every day where you can submit a suggestion which will be read by a discord admin/mod/helper and then voted on by the community if it is a unique idea. Then the accepted ones get passed onto the devs. This ensures the community gets what they want and will keep coming back, instead of being pushed away by unwanted changes in new updates (*cough, cough. Fortnite) 

Negatives/Neutrals- 

- Many 'Do not recommend' reviews mention that 'tail tag' games are unfair and the tail 'GETS ROBBED FROM ME FROM ACROSS THE PLANET' yes, this is the case but it puts you on the edge of your seat during these modes. I do get annoyed with this far grabbing, and it does make me smash my desk. But you have to think, on their screen they are right next to you, not far away. And when you grab a tail from them you are probably miles away on their screen. So you can think about it both ways. Overall the tail games are great, even if they have some issues.

- The hacker issue is fine, the complaints are overreacting by a long shot. In my thousands of games played i have probably come across no more than 10, at a big stretch 15. And even then, it gives you and your friends a great laugh. I've had the pleasure of beating a few of these cocky hackers and it is so funny to think they must be sitting there like the monsters inc. Mike meme. Even without beating them and watching them win is still fun, I've got saved clips of hackers flying up like super man, spectating them 3 miles from the map, a 20 min long jinxed game as 2 players couldn't be reached. Overall, when there is the odd hacker it creates funny memorable moments. 

- There are also complaints about the team modes as a whole, how they can make you lose when you get a bad team, or everyone always teams up on yellow. But i think this isn't a negative. The team modes add a pinch of uncertainty and diversity into the already unpredictable mess this is. 

If you are thinking of getting this game, I advise you to. I bought it myself thinking that I would likely be refunding it and here I am with 25x the maximum amount of hours allowed before you can't get a refund. There are serious updates to come and i can't wait for all the new content that is soon to be. So I will say it again, please give this game a chance and create some great memories whilst gaining those sacred Crowns. It gets your heart pumping for battling 59 pathetic little beans with arms and legs.",True
Epico,True
Would fall a thousand more days.,True
"While fall guys is an excellent game, there is one thing I hate.

Every single game I play now, there are hackers, they just wait until the end of the show then fly to victory. It takes no skill or effort. What leads you to cheat in a game like this? Who hurt you as a child? I know this might be hard for your one brain cell to understand, but jamming your keyboard with your crusty Dorito fingers while jacking off to rule 34 and flying to the finish line is not succeeding in life, as much as you want it to be. You ruin the game for everyone else. I hope you feel good about yourself Fall Guy 5673.
There definitely needs to be an easy way to report these people rather than relying on the devs to catch them. 

That being said, the game itself is fun, upbeat and quick giving it a great vibe, although I feel it could benefit greatly from community created maps. It's a great feeling when you think you're about to lose and then the person in front of you gets smacked in the face by a flying strawberry and you dive across the line being the last to qualify. 

In the end I would still recommend Fall Guys as the game is immensely fun, especially with a couple of friends. Just make sure to put all your skill points into luck because you're gonna need it.

",True
"Very fun game, hours of enjoyment and stress relief with little thought needed!
",True
"Trolls standing at the end near the finish line trying to hold you to prevent you AND them from winning. 

Cheaters who automatically make you be eliminated regardless if you finished the task or not... The tail level, you'll find yourself being eliiminated by cheaters who just make your tail vanish at the very end

Didn't mind thew trolls and cheaters at first but it's happening more and more frequently now. Can the dev's please find a way of making it to where if you camp at/near the finish line you get a timer that just eliminates you? 

Or just DISABLE the holding of other players option near the finish line... Shouldn't be that difficult to fix such a weird and minor issue

TLDR: Even a game like THIS is FULL of cheaters and trolls... not even worth it , I've requested a refund and will keep you updated",False

"Nobody likes see-saw, door dash, perfect match, tip toe, most team games, and any variant on tail tag. But people roll with it because you can get into a new game relatively quickly and maybe you'll be lucky this time. For some people it's certainly enough but still a large portion of the events being deemed unenjoyable or hard to influence as an individual isn't especially good.

Still there's that vein of ""don't take it too seriously"" the game seems to thrive on with the way the controls and physics can be pretty obtuse. At the same time though, they've made winning games a currency for time-limited rare cosmetics. Also, I have to agree with many people that hexa-gone's the only end game that it feels like isn't going to screw you over just for bad luck or starting too far back. 

There'll have to be some broader changes and new events for longevity and variety, and unfortunately right now the devs are swamped with trying to fix server issues and cheating. If they show they have the capability for that later though, then it'll be easier to recommend overall.

Watch some vtubers play it though; that's good fun.",False
"Been playing this game since the first weekend beta. In my honest opinion, I think it's a great game. Its really fun with the shop, battle pass, and the ability to play with friends. While I do recommend this game, I think 20 dollars might be a tad bit too much. Maybe 15 - 18 but still, its a great game and would recommend it for anyone just wanting a fun goofy game to play.",True

"I am really transformed into a whimsical and majestic universe when I play this game. It's like I'm high AF on mushrooms and frolicking through an open and vast maze with my teletubby amigos. When I play this game I time travel back into 1989 when I could barely form a thought or cohesive sentence in my tiny little brain. The game requires about 5% skill, 20% bullshit, and 75% luck. In all reality, $20 for this game is a sham. It's repetitive from the first 2 hours of playing. I've seen better games developed on iOS that cost $3.99.",False

Game is fun and unpredictable and silly. My only complaint is that teaming up with friends should have the feature to easily spectate your friends once you're out without having to memorize their FallGuy#### usernames and then scroll between the other 58 or however many beans are left.

"Too bad that i cannot answer yes and no at the same time for recommending this game. A few pros and cons about this game below. Before reading the below, note that i am a decent Fortnite player playing in Contender league and i am used to the rarity of victory royales. 

Pros:
- game is fun to play and very colorful
- getting new items from the shop with kudos is not too hard if you play decently and qualify for a few rounds each time
- you can just chill and play unlike other battle royales like fortnite where there is much more sweat

Cons:
- this game is the most frustrating i have ever played. I rage quit regularly and do not even do that as often with fortnite. The chance of getting a win is close to 0 no matter how many times you end up in the final round. I am in finals almost all the time. I am level 21 on the season 1 battle pass and have played this game for approx. 24h already. I am still without a single win despite trying so hard. This the only game i play where i have no wins and where a win is very dependent on luck as opposed to other games where you can actually win because you are good and way more in control.
- certain server connection issues need to be fixed
- too many cheaters in that game despite the developper saying he took action. I see regularly players who do impossible things like jumping so far away despite phyics in the game that do not allow this. Same for those who never fall and seem magically sticking to the ground they walk on. This ruins the game and make me want to quit for good because no matter how hard i try in the final round, i will always lose because of people cheating. Why not cheating like they do in order to at least get a win some day???? Now i am hopelessly playing final rounds without any expectation of getting a win because i lost faith and confidence in getting a single win at that game due to what i mentioned above.

This is it so far for this review but will update it if anything comes out or i change my mind around that frustrating game.",True

"I could rant for a while about this game, but if I truly hated it I wouldn't have played it for this long. I get frustrated and then remember that I'm a bean dressed as a slushy, getting pelted in the face by large fruits. So...there's that.

After a short time playing the game in this early stage, you'll realize there are some obvious flaws. Team games seem like a bad option for this format, unless you could search for games against other groups of 2, 3 or 4 players. Then you could battle against other teams in races and sports games, competing as a group. The most frustrating aspects of the game are being eliminated due to glitches (getting stuck inside platforms), lag (getting your tail grabbed from 5 feet away), or team games. Only one of those things is part of Fall Guys' design, so I'm not that mad. 

The races and most of the survival games are fantastic. I would prefer the whole game to be obstacle courses because that's where the fun is. Slime Climb is the best minigame I've played, you need to be decent at the obstacles but you have enough time to make mistakes and recover. Compared to Fall Mountain, I think it would be a much more epic finale. Fall Mountain is the best final round, I personally hate the tail mechanic so Royal Fumble isn't for me, and I get Hex-A-Gone roughly 7/10 times and it's not very exciting. Fall Mountain is epic and feels like it matches the spirit of the game, but it's over much to quick to really allow you to have the ups and downs of Slime Climb.

I'm just sharing my thoughts, if you read this I want you to know that I'm doing well and I hope you are too. Get the game and enjoy yourself, don't worry about winning. You're a hot dog bean person getting launched into oblivion by a giant windmill, life is good.

I have no option to rate the game as like a 6/10, so I would just recommend it. I only see it improving from here, so I doubt there will be a lot to complain about for long. I wouldn't argue with you if you wanted to hold off until a few more updates come down the tube. Just don't forget to come back and join the chaos sometime soon. We need more logical people like you out there to weigh down the see saws for the rest of us, and don't expect anyone to return that favor. Sucker.

"PROS:
- For the first couple of hours it's fine and pretty fun.
- There is some variety in maps and there is sign of new ones coming soon

CONS:
- It's so expensive for the unpolished product you get. 
- The minigames are very unrefined
- Lately there's been desynchronization or lag with other players, which makes it frustrating in minigames in which you need to escape from, or catch other players.
- Sometimes the grab mechanic doesn't work as intended*.
- The minigame randomization feels weird, you can get the same loop of minigames 5 times in a row.
- There are too many minigames that put you in teams, so you have to hope you get a good team but it's up to chance. (I get this is to make it friendlier for people who aren't as used to computer games but it's good to take into account)
- Even though there is variety, after you play for a few hours the maps become really repetitive and stagnant, however, they will probably come out with new maps more often than not.

*In minigames like Tail Tag, sometimes you can literally grab and hold the player with a tail and for some reason you don't get the tail, it has happened to me multiple times.",False

FALL GUYS IS FUCKING GREAT MATE,True
"I originally picked this game up with the expectation that I would really enjoy it -- and I did at first. However, as I continued to play it, I began to notice that there wasn't very much content that the game offered. It only took an hour or so to play every single mini-game there is. The replayability of most levels in the game is pretty abysmal. A lot of the levels in the game consist of running from point A to point B. These levels, in particular, offer little to no challenge what so ever. The team games are a complete joke; the number of players on each team is often skewed, and most of the time, you get paired with trolls who deliberately try to make the team lose. On top of this, the connection to the servers often allows players to grab others from far away and go unphased by grabs. There are two final mini-games - the first one being Fall Mountain - another run to the end the fastest, which often forces you to take the same path each time to win. The second being Hex-a-gone - one of the only mini-games in Fall Guys that requires skill (also my favorite). In the final game I played before uninstalling, I came across a cheater who flew to the end at each level, which completely defeats the purpose of playing the game. They went as far as to purposefully knock people off at the end while flying around in Hex-a-gone.
     In conclusion, the game can be fun but often isn't. I can see why kids would enjoy it, but for anyone looking for a challenge, this game ain't it chief.",False

Their eye makes me feel high, the way they steer into my soul is sooooo magical. My pants becomes a sauna when I think about their feet. The way everyone is so special and knowing that if they were real I could have a new one every day always brings a smile to my face. When I play a always think that every cute little guy is competing for me, and that's the best thing about the game. I recommend this game to everyone who wants to feel the same way as me.",True

"fun and quirky game that reminds me of WipeOut, MXC, Ninja Warrior, except definitely geared towards a G setting. 
not that childish and cuteness can't be fun. figuring out the controls is half the battle, then its execution in a game where up to 60 people are your enemy.

"I couldnt stand playing with friends as there are two things that heavily bother me,

 #1 downtime, if you die you have to wait till your friends finish the game, not only that you have to tab through all the remaining players to try and find your team to spectate them

#2 the menu system, how am i supposed to know if the rest of my team dies without being in voice comms with them. i stay stuck watching random people again. More downtime.

#3 the menu to leave a game is awful half the time it doesnt work and requires a full restart of the game.

"Overall a good and addictive game with endless fun but the only problem is that it's overpriced. This game is even better with friends but the game is too expensive which means not everyone could get it.

"It is a really fun game to play. especially with friends.

But that doesn't mean there arent major issues this game faces. IF you can deal with the following purchase the game, otherwise wait until this is fixed.

- Not that much map variety. If you do 1 long playsession you have seen it all.
- Major server and latency issues. The lag really makes you feel so powerless in some game modes.
- More music, the 1 soundtrack thats in the game is good but gets old really quick.

Overall the game experience is really great and alot of fun if you can look past the issues the game is facing right now.",True

"Ever wanted to play those stupid minigames that contestants partake on game shows?

This.

This is literally it.

Fall Guys is a battle royale style game divided into rounds featuring different minigames. Very quick and fast paced. Minigames are very straightforward and not overly complex. The physics are funny but precise enough. You'll mostly get screwed over by the crowd of other people moving in your general direction. The overall game aesthetic is very colorful and cute, with really cute skins you can earn so you can match with your squad.

Very easy to just jump in and play a few rounds. The minigames are short and sweet. Even if a game sucks, it's over in a minute or two at most. It's not a big commitment, which I love. Even if you get angry from a bad match, it's easy to walk away from the game and come back later. Also no p2w, which is always a bonus.

When the game was initially released, the servers were struggling. Now, they are much, MUCH better and more playable, but it's still evident there are some issues with latency. A bit sad that names are currently disabled, but don't let that deter you from buying this. The dev team has been very receptive to feedback and I can only imagine good things for the game's future.

I was initially hesitant because $20 seemed like a lot for what this was, but after playing a lot, I can guarantee that this is worth the money and I'll most likely be playing for a long time.",True
"Be prepared to lose 99% of the time when it comes to final round. But other than that? Just have fun! The challenges are hilarious, the gameplay is cute, adorable, and sweet. Colorful too! 

- Cons -
Item Shop may as well be Crown Shop. There's very LITTLE stuff to buy with kudos coin. It's kind of pointless to have Kudos currency if the item shop is focused on Crowns which is what you get from winning in a final round. However, You do get 3 pity crowns from leveling up. But, the crowns are overpriced in the Item Shop, so don't bother.

The game is cute. And it's addictingly funny and adorable.",True

The music is constantly hyping the players up. Fall Guys is seemingly a truly chillin' game. Yeah, that's kinda true, in fact, it's guaranteed to make you rage not just once. It's somehow addictive and really enjoyable to play which makes you come back to it again and again even if you aren't doing too well.

"It's fun and addicting. Highly based on Takeshi's Castle, a japanese game show back in the 80's. It gets repetitive at times due to the lack of game modes, but considering the game is only 2 weeks old, I see a bright future in it. Hackers are mostly ruining the game experience, but at least the devs are working on 'em. Some players are kind of annoying, especially the troll ones but hey, the game itself is supposed to work that way. It's totally worth the money. It'll help you kill some of your free time. I don't recommend it to people who have temper issues though and I wish they could fix the name already. Overall, game's great with the exception of hackers.",True

"Fall Guys fell like a breath of fresh air for battle royals by integrating fun old school Japanese-esc game show matches. The game starts to lose its glamor when the lack of an anti-cheat and flying players make a fun experience turn into an ass-bag cheaters daydream(that also cannot be reported due to being anonymous). Another tidbit involves the anonymous name for your player when the game includes customization and differences in players to stand out. 

Overall the game is fun and creative, but requires some fixes in dealing with cheaters and naming . if the changes are made I will update my review and will have a good time. 8/10",False

"Fall Guys is pretty fun, but it is frustrating, too. 

There is a mixture of luck and skill based on the game mode you play, and for the most part people aren't jerks. There are still some trolls, because this is the internet, but overall people just want to play the game. 

This game will probably irritate you, whether it be from people being stupid, grabbing you, getting in your way, or you're own mistakes, but it doesn't make the game any less fun, and if you do get too frustrated to play, you can alt f4 without any penalties. 

Other than that, game is good to play either on your own or with friends, though you can only queue up with a party of 4 max. While you can play this alone, I would definitely recommend you play with at least one other person, it makes the experience more enjoyable, especially if you are on call with them.

The race and logic games are really fun and feel good to play, but the team games honestly don't really fit the game and are a massive pain to play since you have to rely on other people to be good in order to progress.

"I do have a lot of fun with this game and for the most part it seems relatively fair.  However, there are some QOL changes I'd like to see to continue playing more.

1. A report system: There are already cheaters that can fly and speed through these things.  You'll never win against someone like that and there's currently no way of reporting them.  It's very frustrating and demoralizing when you're trying to play and know you can't win.

2. Team games with unfair numbers: I can't tell you how many times I've been put into a team game where other teams had a numbers advantage.  If the number left isn't able to be distributed evenly, then don't allow it to pick that specific type of team game.  (Like you can't split 21 into two teams but you can 3 teams) I feel like this is one of the only things that stacks the odds against you as a player.

3. An option to turn off team games or que with only solo players: I don't mind team games, but I do mind them when I'm playing with a bunch of solos and red team has a squad of four on it that can coordinate better.  This makes a huge difference and I see it happen often in my own games and in streamers games.  I think this would also even the odds a bit.

These are just a couple changes I've thought about while playing that would improve player experience.  Without those, it's still a really fun game and I still recommend others purchase it.  A lot of fun for the price of the game.",True

I think the most appealing aspect about this game is no matter what you are doing: racing, team game, customizing your ""bean"" in the shop with various colors/patterns/outfits, and even dying.........you are ALWAYS enjoying yourself and having fun! I can't remember the last time that I was laughing and genuinely having fun, while dying in a game. I think this game is a first for me in that aspect. 

In the future, I would like the creators to add more variety in levels, which I am sure is coming. I would also like to display my actual username, instead of being referred to as: ""Fall Guy XXXX"". But, those are minor complaints.

If you do not own this game, go buy it now! It is well worth the $20 price tag, and you will have so much fun playing and customizing your bean. But anyways, ya.......GO BUY FALL GUYS!!!

"Fall Guys is essentially Takeshi's Castle, or for the younger US audiences, Wipeout.
It's a simple game where 50 players shaped like cute Tic-Tacs run around doing minigames in three variants: Race, Survival and Teamplay. There is enough minigames to keep you interested for a while, but it will require additional content being added and/or rotated some time in the near future. 
The simple control schematic is very intuitive although I highly recommend using a gamepad, as it makes a world of difference in terms of gameplay comfort.
It's not really competitive as it's designed for fun not e-sports, so it works better playing a game or two during a break from work/chores/whatever than try-harding the game to always be 1st.
You gain enough of in-game currency to buy new cosmetics in the shop and the no-pay (!) Seasonal (?) Exp Rewards system will provide enough of an incentive to fiddle with your tic-tac, regularly changing its colouring, markings and ridiculous outfits. 

After 5 hours of playing I still have some doubts into the responsiveness of some movements (when you grab certain stuff and when not) but it's a minor flaw, which doesn't really build up to any frustration.

The PC version however lacks some options I would love to see added sometime in the future:
- there is no borderless windowed screen so you have to alt+tab minimizing the game 
- the 'Exit game' button is located in the options menu so more often you just use alt+F4
- the logo screens take for ages and there is no way to skip them, so you can't quickly get into the game
- there is no way (at least I haven't found a way) to map the buttons on a mouse
- there is not enough music in the game and it can get tiresome very quickly - i disabled it after an hour

All in all it's a great game and definitely worth a buy.

but the game has issues that take from my enjoyment of it :

CONS :

1- PLEASE FIX THE SERVERS
why should I wait forever to enter a match(for a game that I paid full price for) when my friends who got the game FOR FREE on Playstation 4 can enter a session almost instantly!? that just doesn't make sense!

2- LESS TEAM GAMES
please add more ALL-OUT games instead of team based ones,when I want to chill and play solo I don't want to end up with toddlers or idiots playing for my team! that just sucks the fun out of it!

3- FIX THE PHYSICS OF BALL FALL
seriously do I need to elaborate on this one? that game just SUCKS!!!!! why should a football feel like a sticky slime? when I hit the ball with all my might,diving into it like a bullet,I expect the ball to travel a decent distance,not landing 1 FEET IN FRONT OF ME!!!!! please fix it....

if it wasn't for the first con,I would have recommended the game,but as it is now? the game is just unplayable.

probably not worth the purchase now, i knew the games networking was on the unreliable side... but the fact that players can use hacks to edit their; Movement speed, jump height, grab range, etc etc... just goes to show the devs have make a non complicated game hacker friendly. nothing is server side checked this is why its easy for them.

"Bright colors, groovy music, & fun games. [b]Fall Guys[/b] is an excellent game, however, there are a few kinks here & there.

[h1]PROS[/h1]
⠀• Short, fast-paced games.
⠀• Multiple character customization options.
⠀• A shop that changes often.
⠀• Win-based currency system.
⠀• Quick responses from customer support.


[h1]CONS[/h1]
⠀• A plethora of bugs.
⠀⠀⠀– In Block Party, one can climb onto the side walls. This allows the player to win the
⠀⠀⠀⠀ round without actually playing. You can also get stuck inside of the blocks during
⠀⠀⠀⠀ gameplay, forcing you to be eliminated.
⠀⠀⠀– In both [b]Tail Tag[/b] & [b]Team Tail Tag[/b], you won't always grab another player's tail, even
⠀⠀⠀⠀ though you should be close enough to. Sometimes, you can drag around a player with
⠀⠀⠀⠀ a tail, & you still won't get their tail. It's a very finicky gamemode. 
⠀⠀⠀– Team-based games, such as [b]Fall Ball[/b], often have unfairly matched teams. Many
⠀⠀⠀⠀ a time have I found myself in a 6v5 or a 6v4. Now, once players realize that they're on
⠀⠀⠀⠀ the team with the less amount of players, they tend to automatically leave, which puts
⠀⠀⠀⠀ the team at even more of a disadvantage.
⠀• Inability to display Steam name in-game.
⠀⠀⠀– Players are listed as ""Fall Guy 0000,"" & the game doesn't allow you to input a custom
⠀⠀⠀⠀ name. I want to know the name of the toucan who pushed me off of the map.


[h1]OVERALL[/h1]
If you're willing to work through the bugs, you'll find yourself pouring hours upon hours into this game. It's tons of fun with or without friends, & it's the most family friendly battle royale game on the market.

"Pros:
1) it made me laugh for about 10 mins... then it just lost it's comical appeal, i could see it being fun with large groups of friends but smaller party games or solo - not really.
2) indie like and colorful whacky fun design - playing a stage for the firs time feels fresh with excitement.


Cons:
1) The UI - User Interface is unfriendly, boring, unappealing, and down right frustrating.  The menus are just dull and uninspiring - i just plugged a controller in and start playing on my PC but there was not much to explore or look at it pass the battle pass.
ex: when you are in a match you have to ask your party members in discord audio chat what their fall guys number is. you don't see it on the menus.
2) Repetitive Stages - I only played the game for just under 2 hours and I recount playing the same stages about 3 to 4 times.  Not enough wholesome content for early launch.
3) $20 + dollars? - Seriously? it should be a 3 day trial or a 1 time battle pass that gives you access to all the features. This game is 5 to 10 title at most.  Fortunately, i got my money back - easy refund under 2 hours of gameplay.  I only bought because hype was big on streaming platforms and it gave me an opportunity to stream a new game.
4) Game play - slow pathing and movement feels too easy - not strategic enough for me.   I'm a harder game to please and being in adult hood in my 30's this game just does not have the WOW factor for me. Would play it with my future kids or wife though for a few short lived kicks and giggles.

"What is Fall Guys?

Fall Guys is the ultimate embodiment of party game chaos, sprint to finish lines, push people to an untimely, slimey demise and just make yourself as much of a general nuisance as possible whilst securing your own victories.

The game is best enjoyed with friends, especially if you embrace the chaotic nature of the game and endeavour to hinder your friends as much as possible.

The team games are fun, and add to the chaos, sometimes leading to an untimely elimination, but it's so quick to jump into games that even being eliminated is of little consequence.

The Fall Guys team are an active team, often addressing bugs and issues quickly, meaning they support their title well, and the price of their game has thusfar been well worth it.

The game is suitable for casual gamers and professionals alike, with a myriad of racing shortcuts and optimisations for even the most serious gamer to perfect, whilst the sounds, songs and tumbling chaos of general gameplay is sure to leave a group of friends laughing endlessly to the finish line.",True

"Couldn't join a game for over 5 days(Keeps searching for a long time and comes back with a no match found), and theres hackers all around the place. Wanted to refund but too late now. Would recommend to borrow someone elses to play first then see if you want to get it, but you might have the same issue with me :)",False
"Pros:

The Jelly beans are fun to decorate, especially with the battle pass being free, and nearly everything cosmetic obtainable through playing/winning.

A shared jelly bean hug can quickly develop into one person pushing the other off the top of Slimb Climb, and then doing a taunt.

Most of the ""episodes"" or minigames are unique, and involve their own strategies to learn.

It's a blast with even one friend or frenemy.

The game's damn adorable.

Cons:

If you have high latency then the games involving big balls, such as fall ball, Hoarders, and some of the others will cause a fair amount of frustration, and you'll just be at a massive disadvantage. Fall ball especially is terrible for this, because any normal friction you'd have with the ball is removed and it just rolls over you or through you.

If you have a very hard time winning for whatever reason, then currently* there is no way to acquire a large amount of the nicer items from the store which are bought with crowns you earn from winning.

It's not nearly as much fun playing solo.

It feels pretty bad being the one thrown off a cliff after a hug.

Verdict:

I'd rate this game 9 jellybeans out of 10, but 2 of the 9 jelly beans turn out to be coconut flavored (which I like and others don't) and 1 of the 9 jellybeans is toothpaste (which others like and I do not).


9/26/2020 edit:

Fall guys has implemented Easy Anti-cheat, which has seemingly eradicated every cheater, which is great news for all the honest players. 
The latency I'd experience heavily near the launch of the game has dwindled down to nearly nothing, which is also great news!

As of the recent patch which has introduced multiple variations of most levels, the replay value has gone up considerably. It's clear that the devs took care to prioritize answering the problems that would keep people from playing first, and now have begun giving their player-base fun new things.

Modified rating: 9/10 jellybeans. I still scream with excitement when I win a crown, furrow my brow in concentration on the harder levels, and moan and complain when I get the levels I still don't like. Best with friends, but fun alone if you enjoy the game enough. Mediatonic has done a brilliant job designing this game.",True
Fun little game. Can't wait for more levels!,True
"EDIT>  Almost every match i've layed recently has a hacker init that just flies thru the mapsAs a kid who watched every Wipeout episode back in the day, i love this game and i hope they keep making new mini-games and race courses since the popularity and support for the game skyrocketed.

it has some minor flaws but you barely notice it due the amount of fun you'll have, specially with friends.

All cosmetics except the two small cosmetic DLCs can be earned just by playing since the battlepass is free.

can't wait to see where the devs take this!

1. There are games based on chance so RNG can determine whether you win or lose
2. You can only win as a solo but play games as a team. Your team can determine whether you win or lose

Now i'm by no means a good player, but having other people decide if i can win is kinda dumb. There should be a ""team"" based lobby with only team games. A solo based lobby where team games are removed. RNG games should be removed as it requires no skill... Can you imagine other BR games relying on RNG for wins?

"Casual battle royale platformer can bring you to insanity in a few minutes.

It's a very easy game to pick up and play for all ages. Very quick games, allow players to hop in and out as they please. Grouping up with friends is fun, and while it doesn't really increase the odds that you will win, you at least have someone to root for after elimination.

That enjoyment sort of slows down after my play sessions pass about an hour. The RNG/Luck based game balance takes a toll after a while for me. From spawning in the back of the pack to getting unfortunately placed on the team that gets ganged up on, sometimes the match outcome feels out of your hands.

Ultimately it boils down to more playtime doesn't equal skill in this game, a win can happen on your first game or your hundredth it mainly depends on if you get lucky. With the many pitfalls that can trip the player up and remove those possibilities where a win would have existed definitely doesn't feel good and usually caps off the play session with a sour mood.


Overall I think the game has a fun atmosphere. It can be a enjoyable experience in small doses, but I don't think it has the charm of a game that'll keep you playing for hours on end.

"The game has a cute style, goofy gameplay, and is overall super charming. What's not to love?

Well... while I do recommend the game I do have a couple gripes. It mostly comes from the lack of maps (which I'm sure they'll fix over time) and the imbalance of team based games in later rounds. Trying to play a game like Fall Ball feels super RNG based when teams are 4v5, regardless of the skill a player has (or lack thereof).

While I have seen complaints of ALL team based games not really being the best in general, you can't really blame the game itself for giving you a bad team.

"B E A N S

Fall guys is the most refreshing take on the battle royale genre since it exploded a few years back. The biggest draw of the game is its simplicity. You're a bunch of bean things running around knocking into one another all to win an episode of the game show you're on. The game's quick to jump in and jump out of. A loss in the game isn't too frustrating because you can hop back in pretty much immediately - and losing early while playing with your buds isn't a big deal because the episodes are short enough that you'll be playing again within 5-15 minutes (depending on how well they do).

The art style of the game is simply fantastic. It's colorful, vibrant, and brimming with this sort of pop-ish energy that you'd find in games like Splatoon. The entire soundtrack is also full of absolute bangers. If you play this game with the music off, you're doing yourself a disservice. 

The gameplay of the game is uber simple. Litearlly just running, jumping, diving, and grabbing. The game keeps this gameplay interesting by making you have to run and jump around with 59 other players (max) at a time in a variety of minigames. The minigames are varied enough to be distinct from one another. Once you've played one you'll remember each and every part of it. Some of the minigames are definitely not as well designed as others - I'm looking at you egg gathering team game - but they are at least still fun.

My primary issue with the game is its severe lack of content. After about 6-12 hours of playing you'll basically have seen every minigame Fall Guys has to offer multiple times. However, the devs seem to be aware of this and are addressing this via adding new minigames here and there. Hopefully they keep this up so the game can keep up its momentum.

A small blight on the game is that the game costs $20 - is pretty bare bones in content - but has microtransactions for the easily earnable in-game currency. I simply don't understand why this is in the game. Like I said, you can earn the currency super easy, so it just seems like it's just there to be there. I think it would've been better to just not include them so they don't mare the game at all. Why have us pay to skip playing your game after all?

I think the customization is a bit lacking as well. The outfits you can buy in the shop and such tend to cover up all of your colors/patterns, so you just end up looking like anyone else with that costume part on. It'd be nice if they let you recolor the outfits, but they instead have you purchase recolorings in the store when they happen to be in rotation. This isn't a problem itself, but I feel it is just there to cover up the lack of actual costume customization in the game. This is a relatively minor issue though, don't get me wrong. The customization is still good enough to be fun to play with.

Lastly, I think the game could use more ways to earn crowns. Currently you can only earn crowns by winning or getting them via the battle pass unlocks. I've played the game for a bit over 20 hours at this point, and I've only won 7 times. Meanwhile items in the store - like the featured items - can cost upwards of 5 crowns for both the top and bottom piece of an outfit. I like the high price for the featured outfits, but I found it annoying for the daily shop items. I think earning an extra crown every once in a while outside of the season pass system would make the crown items feel more obtainable via regular play. 

Overall though, I quite enjoy Fall Guys. It's a great game that I recommend playing with all your friends asap. If they keep the momentum up with the game I believe it has the potential to stick around for at least a few years.",True

The main issue used to be server problems, but they basically fixed it so that is great. Now my main issue is the rng based team games and the minigame selection. I have never gotten jump showdown but i've gotten fall mountain 7/10 times. There needs to be equal chances for each minigame. Tell me, how many times have you played jinxed in the first 10 hours of playtime? Less than 10 likely. Also I hope they remove fall ball from being a top 10 playlist. 4v5's are unfair. Anyways this game is an absolute chad and you should pick it up.",True

"Dumb fun

Update: The novelty has worn off a bit, so I still stand by my initial review, but with some additional clarification. This is definitely a ""Party Game"", and can be played solo, but is better with friends. Constantly getting eliminated by shenanigans when you're chasing crowns starts to wear you down, but having friends to share the experience with both elevates the small victories and cushions the times when you get eliminated. So, to update: Dumb Fun with Friends

Update to the Update: Still *definitely* more fun with friends, but if you learn to embrace the shenanigans, switch up your costume/outfit occasionally (The real ""endgame"" is F A S H I O N), and focus on making progress to the next item on the Battle Pass, solo players can still have fun.

"While this game is fun and I do enjoy it, it does have a lot of potential to be better and I am excited for what else the game brings to the community. 

One thing I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT STAND at the moment is team games especially when you are solo queuing to victory. The team games seem very unbalanced just like in fall ball it will either be a 4v5 or 6v7 which already puts one team at a disadvantage and I always find myself having absolutely useless players and feel I'm guaranteed to lose. Call me trash or whatever especially with the amount of hours I have but honestly it really needs to be changed. 

Also if you're reading this, in team tail if u see me on your team and I have a tail DO NOT GRAB MY TAIL AND END UP LOSING IT AND WE GET KNOCKED OUT OF THE GAME! By far the most frustrating thing in the game and it drives me insane how one person could literally ruin the round for the whole team.

"Fall Guys is a battle royale style of game. They put 60 people in different maps and mini games. Each mini game will eliminate a number of players, and as long you survive the competition you will reach the final mini game, that whoever survive last, will win the game, and as a reward, will won a crown that you can use to buy cosmetics.
The game is really enjoyable, the graphics and characters are really cute and the mini games are very funny, it might be very difficult to get a victory at the early hours of playing the game, but when you achieve a victory it is very worth the effort. 
Fall Guys has an in-game store that you can buy cosmetics as skins and emotes, and the best is that you dont need to pay real money for than, just play and you will get purple coins or crowns (if you get victorys) and then you will be able to buy cosmetics to make your character more custom.
The game has also a battle pass, that has 40 levels. Its really easy to acheive the maximum level because you dont need much exp to pass the battle pass levels. The battle pass is completely free, and u can get a lot of cosmetics just playing and improving your level.
Fall Guys has 2 DLCs that you can buy with real money. The skins are very funny but if you think you wont play the game a lot its not worth to buy, you can get others skins just playing.
You can also play the game with your friends because fall guys has a lobby that fits 4 people.
I paid 6,7 dollars and I am enjoying the game a lot, a lot of my friends bought the game too and we are having a lot of fun trying to reach the victory while competing with other players.

Pretty fun but some of the team games are really dumb because of lag. The soccer minigames feel unfun with bad connection as you seemingly partially phase into the ball and have little to no effect whereas the opposing team can just yeet it across the map into your goal. It's common knowledge that the tail minigames are dumb and should be at least temporarily removed while they fix the latency. Also the legendary skins are dumb. Getting 10 wins for the Scout skin is unfair when many minigames can be ruined by bad connection or bad luck. The grabbing and pushing people around was funny but making the legendary cosmetics cost so many crowns when you get so few from the battle pass makes people play more to win rather than to have fun. This leads to people trying to throw others out of the game to have less competition. In the end it is just skins and a way for people to show off their 'skill' so it really doesn't matter much. You can get a lot of enjoyment from the game in it's current state and if they're consistent with updates and new levels then it should be popular for a while.,True

It's fun but it needs a good amount of polishing. Whenever you fall down it can vary on getting up instantly or being stuck on the ground constantly being run over unable to move. The grabbing system really shouldn't be in a gamemode where it isn't needed because people will just grab you as they are about to die. The tiles gamemode is absolutely broken if you try and find the path you lose. It also seems to register very differently for different people. Grabbing tails seems to be a 50/50 of either getting it from 5 feet away or having to be right next to someone. Sometimes I cross the finish line before someone else and it wont register me as getting there first. It's fun but the mechanics kinda put a damper on the experience especially team games that you just have a random chance of winning. It's still fun and highly recommendable.,True

Only apparent issue I have along with many others are some games are just pure RNG. Regardless if youre a god level talent at this game or that gamemode, it is impossible to carry a team by yourself. 

Some things the game devs could do is the implementation of custom maps that the user base could create because let's be honest, at some point we will all get bored of the playing on the exact same map many hours in and the ability to disable specific game modes, exclusive to custom servers only of course.

Because the way I see it, the game will be fun initially, then after many hundred hours invested, it will become boring real quick.",True

I don't think this is game I could play for hours, it's more of a quick blast type of game. It's very good though, but tough as well. It can be very difficult to qualify on some courses as the scrum for positioning can be absolutely chaotic and you can go from first to last - through no fault of your own - in a matter of seconds.

The only thing i don't mind (because you can get over it) is that in tail games on your screen someone grabs your tail from kilometers away even though on their screen they are right next to you. Nothing really can be done about that because we all have different internet speeds. All the devs would need to do is try and improve connections. Maybe allow the server to delay people who are running at higher internet speeds than anyone else and delay it to the point were it is imbeetween or the average off all the people pings in the game. It might cause teleportation though. My idea might not work but this was written off the top of my head so it is kinda brainstorming.",True

Summary: Good core concept, good primary loop gameplay, terrible secondary/tertiary loop gameplay.

There are some amusing concepts in Fall Guys, but these around surrounded by terrible structural choices. If another developer made a game with a similar primary loop (mascot platforming and party games), I would try it. But this game is terrible.

Mascot running an obstacle course? Fun.
Poor jumping controls? Not fun.
Obstacles where outcomes depend on what competing players do, i.e. the see-saw? Not fun.
Emphasis on spectating? Not fun.
Elimination-based system where losing involves a large amount of luck? Not fun.
Hiding the quit button in the settings menu? Punishable by death.

This is Mario Party meets PUBG or one of those elimination-based battle royale games. But in Mario Party, if you lose a mini-game, by luck or skill, you keep playing.

In Fall Guys, if you make a mistake, you stop playing. If you're unlucky, you stop playing. If you're playing a team game and you're unlucky with the team balance, you stop playing.

So if you like Mario Party, but want more frustration, anger, and disappointment in your life, this is the game for you. And you should probably seek help.",False
good gaem,True
"Fun Game, Good Game but makes you rage a lot... they need to fix some glitches and logic in the game",True
"Don't be fooled by the down votes or non-recommendations base off of the ""servers"". Those reports had come when the game was first released. No game is perfect upon launch and especially with the sheer numbers of players that were trying to get on all at once. 

Those individuals are not developers, server owners, or system administrators. So, their cries of ""Its not working"" is coming from an impatient, and non-understanding about how long server upgrades and maintenance takes. 

The developers of the game are a small team that have handled all the 10-year old whining children and 40 year old whining children fantastically. 

The game is great when playing with friends and solo. This is not a game that I would binge for 10 hours a day, but this is a game that I consistently come back to every day, play a bit, have a few laughs, and then leave it for tomorrow's adventure. 

The only thing I wish they would bring back are the names. Although, I  don't know why usernames were removed -- most likely because there were some pretty vulgar names and children play this -- I wish there was an option to turn usernames back on. (If there is a way to do this please let me know.)

"The idea of the game is great, but the implementation is not.

First, the servers are often down and even when they are not, you can be disconnected from a game. (Update: The server are working and the disconnection are very rare now)
Second, the playability is highly dependent on your setup. I have played with a laptop and ADSL connection and after each jump I was falling. On my desktop with fiber connection, the problem seems to have vanished.
Third, interaction with other players suffer from huge lags. For example, other player positions are not properly display resulting in being hit by an invisible guy during a jump or loosing your tails to a guy out of reach.

The game is still fun to play with the right setup, but I would advise to wait before buying the game that they solve all those issues and I truly hope that they will do it.

SUGGESTIONS

See Saw  
We know we hate it... Maybe making the tilting a bit slower or more stiff might help make it more possible, maybe making it so it can't tilt all the way throwing you off.

Door Dash
Well I dunno, but if you go first usually you end up regretting, maybe making it a colour coding thing and it calls out the colours as you get closer.

Slime Climb
Make the slime rise slower maybe... Way too many get eliminated otherwise and unable to learn the map...

Block Party
Make the walls higher on the sides so people don't jump there for the entire game.

Tail Tag
Maybe its more a game of tag where you are it and if you have the tail you have to give it to someone else, idea for a level because tail tag is one of my least favourite....

GET RID OF THE GOLDS.... THEY ARE NOT FAIR ESPECIALLY IN RNG HOOP LAND

Fall Mountain
Start in second row, start with a disadvantage....

Just ignore everyone who talks about server issues. This game is new on release and there is no possible way anyone could've predicted the popularity of the game. It is a great game although the teams games are not the best. I think maybe there should be a game mode just for team games because I don't feel like the team games go well with the normal games. Overall an amazing game.,True

"ok so fall guys is very fun and addictive, however there are a few problems

1. massive Lag, people can grab tails and do other things while not being near enough to do that, this is a massive issue!
2. see-saw, This map is so bad and un-fun 
I usually afk and go get food instead of playing it. if you get ahead in see-saw you have an advantage so massive its unfair and if you are knocked over by someone else or miss a jump you fall behind, If this happens you are in see-saw hell where no one knows how to use a see-saw and you just fall further behind. While the people in the front just keep going with no problems. tl;dr remove see-saw
3.Lack of veriety, The game needs twice as many levels.
4.Lack of veriety. The game needs things like jump pads and power ups to change how the fall guys move. a jump pad for example would be practical, fun and make games like fall ball more fast paced and fun.

ideas for games
make the match one everyone be other than your own avatar is invisble makes it more of a challege
Maybe are gamemode of the spinning circles but the have to jump to different ones whiule moving could use like a middle light be green and red to represent when it might fall.
 fall mountain make everyone line up in one line makes it fair
U could also do weekly test mini games for fun like a 60 person hex a gon 
different maps or like rotate fans etc just to mix it up .
also what if workshop builds which people can send to u it can be an amazing way to involve people aswell you could make it a compation if u wanted 
thanks for reading cant wait to see how this game develops please like this so the creators can see",True
Fall Guys is for sure very entertaining and enjoyable!! It's so fun to play with your friends and can last for such enjoyable gameplay for hours and hours. Some of the games do tend to happen way more than others which is a bit annoying as some very fun games you don't see that much. I also wish the max party size would be a tad bit larger than 4.

It's chaotic, it's silly, it's even downright infuriating at times, but the art style is top notch, the sound effects are adorable and endearing, and it's downright hilariously fun.

It is not just amazing to be in contention to win your first crown, but you may get even more excited for your friends to do so as you cheer them on! I have only captured a few of them myself but there are few moments in games that are as amazingly hype as winning a crown with all of your buddies watching, and vice versa when a friend does the same.

I probably laugh most times I fall just because the animation of the characters make you raise an eyebrow from time to time. It’s definitely a game that has you saying “What?” most rounds. Roblox MEGA OBSTACLE COURSE is a super close comparison to Fall Guys. Even the movements your characters make is almost the same as the OG styled roblox character. The face plants and the getting stuck between a moving obstacle for a few seconds.  I see a lot of other reviews mentioning “it needs more maps” , which I agree.

"Seriously can you's hurry up and fix shit? It's just getting worse. The difference between your client and server side is the worst I've seen on any game. It's a good game, but I can't give it a good review until the plethora of bugs are fixed. There's simply too many to justify a positive review right now.

There's clearly a massive difference between client-side view and what's actually happening on the server. I can be borderline touching the person in front with a tail and it won't register my grab. But when I have the tail, they'll be nowhere near me and be able to grab it. Whether they're close on their screen, I don't know, but on my screen they're 1 - 2 bodies away. Sometimes during the tail game, I'll grab someone with a tail from behind and pick them up, but it won't give me the tail.

Another massive issue for me is the consistency of recovery. There will be times where you fall over and can't get up for 3 - 4 seconds while other times you'll be thrown around in a crowd of people and being hit constantly and you'll recover so quickly. It's extremely inconsistent. 

The game is absolutely fun with friends, but until these issues are fixed, no positive review from me. Hopefully y'all fix your servers soon, too. Regularly putting half the team in a match and kicking the other half is extremely frustrating!",False

Not only did it have day one DLC. but the game becomes repetitive within 2-3 hours. (right within that refund window) There aren't enough minigames, many of them aren't fun to play. The teambased games are the worst and I'm hoping they'll separate these into their own queue later, instead of forcing everyone to endure playing with trolling randoms. The final match minigames are painful too, two of them rely on luck whereas one of them (Hex-a-Gone) is actually competitive and fun.

Once you inevitably get into a team game, its very hard to have fun. Especially since all team games end up just how they started. Which means, if one team started out weak, they are doomed to be eliminated with no way to recover whatsoever throughout the entirerity of the round.
Only 2 out of 18 team games, I did get qualified to the next round, no matter what I tried. Relying not only on yourself, but your teammates is not helping getting further. Especially if all the other teams start picking on your team. Which is always going to happen.

I think its the 20 bucks worth!
DISCLAIMER: If you are extremely competitive, maybe this game isn't for you, as a big part of the game is luck based and you can not only win by just being skilled.

"The reviews for this game seem to be decisive -- you either hate it or you love it. 

There's a lot of hype around this game and a lot of attention on it right now, which isn't a bad thing. (It is a bad thing for their servers -- they have been down often around the release date) However, if you're expecting this to be the GOTY ""battle royale"" game, then you are expecting too much. If you're expecting a serious game where you rely on your ""reaction time"" and 

I will also say that the starting price of $20 is a bit steep in my opinion. There is an in-game store, and the inclusion of a free ""battle pass"" encourages progress in the game. However, for the amount of minigames currently in the game, I believe $20 is a bit too steep. The game itself is polished. I love the graphic style, the sound design, and the gameplay. With more mini-games in the future, private lobbies, and better server reliability, this game can be something great. At its current state, you should temper your expectations.

This game is good as a casual ""mammal brain"" or ""reptile brain"" game -- meaning that it's perfect for games you want to play in the background and not put too much thought into it. The game is also much more fun when you're not taking everything too seriously. 

You'll encounter events like the following:
    - Jellybeans will push you off the map suddenly. 
    - Jellybeans will grab you as you jump and mess up your jump.
    - Large fan blades will knock you into the wall. 
    - A large boulder will crash into you and you'll lose all of your progress upp a mountain. 
    - You'll be trampled by a gigantic crowd of jellybeans when trying to go through one door.

Players have issues with other ""toxic players"" who push/pull other jellybeans to eliminate them -- but it's a battle royale game and frankly, a good tactic to eliminate other players. (Someone can explain in the comments how grabbing other jellybeans, a game mechanic, is toxic behavior in a battle royale game?)

The degree of randomness, luck, and chaos I explained is expected of a game like this. It's not an eSport game where you have to spend 40 hours a week mastering your skills. I don't think there's a way to master the mechanics of a game like this because there will always be a degree of randomness and luck in every match. You can play your first match of the game and win. You can play 5000 matches and find that you still not consistently win.

This is a goofy, casual game with hilarious, ragdoll chaos.
Have fun and embrace the chaos!

Don't play this game as an eSport to replace CS:GO or some other serious game.
It's not meant to be that.

[b]- Conclusion -[/b]
Overall, I would still recommend this game. I applaud the level of polish that went into this game and I have been following the game since its development. The gameplay is what I expected it to be and it is what I expected from a game like this. As I said before, $20 is a bit steep. However, it looks like they are planning future updates and I have no problem paying the initial $20 to support this venture and future updates.",True

This is especially annoying in the last round when you just know you can't win.

The games aren't evenly random - I played the one with the two rotating bars exactly one time of the 40 games I've made it to the last round.  Also they should allow for bigger party queues and not force them together for team games.

Definitely worth 5 bucks, could be worth the full 20 if some small changes were made.",True

"This game is an absolute laugh to play with friends, there hasn't been any moments where I haven't been having fun with the game. Even if you get knocked out of the round, its quite funny to spectate friends and watch the chaos unfold.

There are definitely some elements of old game shows such as Takeshi's Castle, Total Wipeout and Hole in the Wall, kinda.

The levelling system and character customisation adds an extra bit of reward to the game, adding a sense of reward and progress to the game. You can mix and match costumes and items you unlock/purchase using 'Kudos' and 'Crowns' which you can earn solely through playing. Finally a game that doesn't require you to invest any money into cosmetic items (other than the two costume DLCs, which really aren't needed). 

There is currently a lack of game modes and obstacle course maps, however the game has only just been released so hopefully many more will be added in the future. Despite the slight repetitiveness, I haven't yet found myself getting bored or annoyed of playing the same maps. 

Also, some of the modes such as 'Scrambled Eggs' and the Hoop mode seem a little out of control. You cannot really win based on individual performance, so you have to rely on your entire team being in the right places at the right time to progress. 

I totally recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a fun, lighthearted battle royale game to play with their friends.

such a fun addictable game,True
"Well this game has the potential of the best game of the year (imo). But atm they need to fix alot of stuff...

First of all maintenance in this game is garbage but hopefully that'll be fixed in the future it's not a big deal in my eyes as this game has just been realeased and must give it time but still they need to fix it asap.

 Second of all Team modes bring this game down so low, you could have the best run you could ever imagine than you'd get fall ball or something in the finals and it'll ruin your run. i've ran a little test and checked out the % of you getting fall ball in the finals i'd say it's 50/50 which is terrible. Egg Scramble another team mode that is horrendous. it's either have a good team or bye bye. Same kinda goes for Hoarders good team yeah you in it to win it, but if you got a bad team byeeeeeeeee byeeeeeeeeee. And the rest of the team modes are meh or kind of good.

 But what are the good things about this game??? Well easy anwser. Battle Royale mixed in with marioparty like minigames, it truly is a great idea. And the solo minigames are awesome, they're fun, enjoyable and has replayability to maximum (imo). Cosmetics are really cool. Music in this game is cartoony, nice and outright cinematic and epic in the finals rounds.


(review time) yeah if they can fix the maintenance, make the modes better and add new maps/modes every month/2 week or something like that, it could work out. Final Review. This game has got potential but needs some major changes...  7/10.",True

Not many games out there that align with both our interests, but the wholesome competition of Fall Guys has us both hooked!  It is our very own Takeshi's Castle/Wipeout!

The costumes and emotes are so fun to collect, but everyone knows the pigeon head and the rainbow tutu is a guaranteed Round 5 finisher, I still find myself changing up costumes every few shows.  I'm really hoping that they do special outfits for holidays as well.  

This is definitely a great game for friends and family.  I look forward to the future updates from Mediatonic as they build upon this great foundation they've created.

"Fall Guys is the kick in the shorts the Battle Royale genre so desperately needed. Its mix of colorful graphics and funny mini games, as opposed to other offerings of the genre like PUBG and Fortnite, really helps it stand out among the crowd. Its fast paced feeling allows the gamer to jump in and play for hours without feeling any sense that they are stuck waiting at menus. Despite a few technical glitches here and there, and server problems apparent at launch, this game is an absolute gem to play by yourself or with three other mates. 9.5/10.",True

"Simple, yet loads of fun! Better with friends",True
"Fun game for trolling people. You can do this by grabbing other players and throwing them off the map which ruins their round. It is also quite a competitive game as it is always knockout rounds so it makes the griefing even more satisfying. I would recommend playing with friends as it makes the game more enjoyable. The only skill mechanics are jump, grab and dive. The dive mechanic is very useful if you are a skilled player. Also you can play on either keyboard and mouse or controller which gives more flexibility on personal preference. At first I thought £15.99 was a little pricey however I realised that the developers need a way of making money from this game and the season passes are free, there is no pay to win so the only thing you can spend money on is cosmetics. Every mode in the game is free and there are no paid for downloadable content. Overall I think £16 is a fair price. 
The things that I dislike are: 
1) You cannot use (side mouse buttons /scroll wheel / middle click) as a key bind.  
2) The modes get a little repetitive after a while. (i'm sure they will add more game modes)
3) Game is not cross platform (cannot play with players on PS4 or Xbox etc.)

"a good example of a good game with a painful release

this game has a lot of issues and quirks that are entirely fixable and probably will be fixed over time. I'll address the issues in order of worst to okay-est, including:

team games - lots of unfair mechanics at play here. right off the bat, teams can be uneven which is sort of frustrating because whenever this happens there's at least one other game that could have been selected which wouldn't have created this problem, almost 100% of the time leading to an unjustified loss.
on top of that, there are plenty of occasions where you will make no fault of your own and you can lose purely because your other team mates played poorly, especially in team tail tag, where if you have a tail at the end (literally the most you can contribute to your team) you can still lose if your other teammates didn't have more tails than the other teams.
the reason why I addressed this issue first is because imo it's currently the worst part of the game. I'm pretty much having a blast every moment except when I'm playing a team game.

tail minigames: really badly executed in general. literally nothing in the first 3 quarters matters because all tail games are counted by how many people have a tail at the very end of the game. this often means the most fun strategy is to just chill in the middle of the map for the first part of the match and only start actually playing the game at the very end. 
tail games should be counted either by how long you've had the tail or a time quota. the current determinate method is barely functional

server issues: to be expected from a game of this nature that completely blows up in popularity. they're slowly starting to address this issue, thank god. just needs some more time to settle if anything

hackers/cheaters: are a thing. if the netcode was done better, the game would be able to detect if someone is cheating but instead we have a situation where the server trusts the client side meaning there's been several occasions of speed hackers, flyers, etc. luckily they dont appear too often and this will most likely be fixed in due time

every other issue is so minor it's barely worth addressing. seems like a lot at first but once again, most of these issues will probably be fixed soon. I hope, at least

tl;dr buy it and play it if you've been on board or want the season 1 level up rewards. otherwise I'd highly recommend waiting for the game to be more refined

"I underestimated this game and how fun it would be.
Definitely has some issues, the main ones being the server and the connection issues, but I believe this is going to get fixed over time.
Personally I didn't think this game would even reach 20k people playing at the same time, this game is currently peaking at +100k players daily. I can't know the expectations of the developers about this game, but I can say with a certain confidence that they didn't expect that ridiculous amount of players at the same time, so the server issues are understandable.
I also think there is an issue with the RNG of the game, there are some mini-games that happen very often and others that are pretty rare (In 7 hours of playing the beta and the released game, I played Roll Out three times and I played Jinx ONCE, meanwhile I'm playing that ridiculously easy memory game in basically every match).
Aside from that, the game is just extremely fun, even playing by yourself is addicting. The mini-games are surprisingly fun, I thought they would get extremely stale real fast, but I was wrong, at the time I'm writing this I'm not sick of any of them (Maybe just the memory one, because again, it's ridiculously easy, you just have to follow everyone and you'll win effortlessly)

"Wait and see. This game is not worth the price of admission at the current price of $19.99 USD, amd with microtransactions (they call it DLC) they are charging this should've been a freemium or $8-10 USD game.  At the the time of writing there is too few events and the servers are taking as much as a beating as the players are.  Fun in small doses and frustrating in long term. As usual better with friends. 

One of the key things this type of game needs in order to thrive is the variety of events to keep the players engaged and at this point in time there is too few.  The game will always start with a race event and at this point in time there are only 6 from the pool.  This gets old way too fast. Within maybe an hour or so, you've potentially played all the events at least once and the races at least multiple.  Each run can last 4-5 rounds meaning a lot of games will be played from the limited pool and repeats will happen potentially happen within 3 rounds.  Servers are currently taking a beating for the influx of new players since it's the first weekend of the game release. They've gone down twice in my playthrough so far and one of them disconnected me from the reward server so I didn't get anything for playing the round.

"After 10+ hours into the game i can list down a few good and bad points.

Good points:

Fun-
The game is actually fun in lots of good ways. There is a lot of variety of obstacles and rounds in the game. Although it can get old. But still so far I’m not sick of it yet.

Cosmetics-
The outfits look really nice. Like a lot like damn. I feel like i want to collect them all coz the theme and designs are really planned out and they all look stunning.

Micro transitions-
There is no necessary micro trans needed. Most of the shit you get are in game currency u get from playing and winning.  The only micro are the dlcs which are cosmetic bundles. But the free currency skins are still very good. And you do get a lot from the free season pass

Theme-
The game is vibrant and colorful supporting with funny looking people which gives off a really stupid and ridiculous vibe which I enjoy. This really helped me in the time of need when I was depressed a couple of days ago coz the game is just so good and funny.

Sort of bad points

Bugs and issues-
This really isn’t an issue at all. Because 1/16 games will make me disconnect which is a good thing coz the issue is minor. And there are some lag spikes which result in rubber banding but in the end, it doesn’t really affect much but then again, it’s still a new game.

Repetitiveness- 
Then again. It’s still repetitive like the games will keep on repeating. But this can be good coz u can master the rounds to make you more likely to be the victor. And some games are more annoying then others but then that’s just your luck.

Grind-
If you play to collect the outfits. You will be needed to grind a lot. Depending in the badge u get ul get around 100-200 per game. And most cosmetics are around 1-7k so grind is a real issue. But if you’re having fun then sure it’s all good.

Overall:
Personally, I think you should get it. If you have extra cash on you then I say its worth it. Heck if you exactly have the cash. Just buy it its really a good game and I quite like it. I would pick it over valorant and fortnite. Because you actually earn something in the game (and its free). Plus if you have friends it can be a really good party game to play or even just a game to play while vibin to some beats with a cold one

"The more I play this the more obvious it becomes that a lot of the games are complete RNG and not really skill-based. 
- Fall mountain is utter trash and you winning it is up to 90% RNG and 10% skill.
- The tail games suck because you can just AFK until the last 10 seconds and then quickly steal a tail. (the team one is alright but the solo one is really bad)
- The one where you need to remember the fruit is pointless because you just go to where everyone else is going and that works out 90% of the time.
- The team-based games are based on your teams' performance as a whole (obviously), so even if you're the best Fall Guys player in existence you can still lose those rounds because of a bad team, and those teams are completely random so it's just pure RNG whether or not you get a good one.
- Tip Toe is just bad, there's no strategy to it except for waiting for someone else to find the path and then following them. 
- The hoops game is fun, but pure RNG.


I think for this game to survive, you need to remove or improve all the bad games and add in new fresh ones every couple of weeks or so. The game is fun, but it has a LOT of flaws which is understandable for such a new game. In a game like this I think RNG should be kept to a minimum and all the games should be skill-based. In the final rounds especially I think it is super unfair to have people spawn in further back than others like in Fall Mountain. 

I also think the game is pretty damn overpriced, I think half its current price would be reasonable. Hopefully once the hype has died down they will put the price down to something more reasonable.",True

"I think the best word to describe this game would be fun, because this game is just pure fun. Many games nowadays don't focus on fun as much as they should, but the devs of this game have knocked it out of the park by reinventing the stale battle royale genre with a new idea that is insanely addictive. I expected to not play the game very long but buy it just to try it out, but in the blink of an eye I already have over 30 hours in the game and plan on putting in many more. While the game is far from perfect, some games like Slime Climb, See Saw, and basically every team game could use some reworks, but even the games that I would consider my least favorite I still have a blast with. There are many things I wish I could change, but for now it's looking like these are being heavily requested and will most likely be changed in future updates, alongside new modes and cosmetics. This is by far the most fun multiplayer game I've played in a while, and it has huge potential to keep a huge community for a very long time.",True

Hex-a-gone is great but i feel you shouldn't be able to fall over just from falling down 1 platform because your dude can't get back up in time before falling to another floor. Also would love to see harder levels and longer levels, modes like slime clime, dizzy heights, and whirlygig have great length, but modes like fall mountain and hit parade are way too short,  the only thing that makes this game remotely challenging is the other players being in your way. Want to see a slime clime on roids

-Really popular right now, so a lot of people you may know have this game or want to get it. Also this will permote the devs to work on it a lot more due to all that $$$ coming in

-Fun and chaotic gameplay as you compete with other beans
-Addicting as all hell.
-Cool cosmetics and free ""battle-pass"" 

Cons:
-Hackers, no anti-cheat right now
-Server have crapped out before, but they seem to be fine for now
- A bit expensive for what it is right now. A 10-15 $ game thats priced at 20$. I think the devs will make it worth 20$ though.
-If you get good at the game team matches suck and always will cause you to loose due to new players.

Super funny game!,True
"EDIT: Changed this to a not recommended after I found out that instead of running another round to reduce the number of players when it is odd, the game just put a team minigame with one team bigger than the other.

Beware that team minigames are mixed with ""single player"" minigames which pretty much killed the fun for me after a few hours out of frustration thanks to huge ammount of luck needed in team matches since they are also elimination rounds. 

If you fall into a bad team it doesnt matter what you do, your run is over. Also the team minigames are poorly designed with usually only one team out of three or more being eliminated rewarding either playing passively(eg: the tail grabbing team game) or ganging up and bullying the one already losing team instead of trying to get a better score (like the push the ball thingy or the eggs one). The jump in the rings game feels like a coin toss since more often than not the teams will have a very close score only changing randomly in the last second. And the curse minigame is just awful and I can't explain why it just feels terrible.

I think it's a very bad design decision to put single player minigames with team-based minigames in a game that has no communication of any type and all the rounds are a ""win or out"" situation (game has no chat of any type and the ""ranked"" mode, where you win crowns, is the only mode available). Want to keep the team minigames? Make them qualifying rounds instead of elimination ones (somehow...). But I rather wish they were just moved into a completely separated category of minigames. Sure its a casual game and the team minigames are really fun at first. I loved the eggs minigame, its just hilarious... But because they also are elimination rounds and a huge RNG factor (specially since the game has no chat) the frustration overcomes the fun/funny factor of them really quick.

Also I wish there was a way to use emotes instead of animations.... it makes no sense to use animations in a game where pretty much one is running all the time.. no one is going to stop to use them so they are just bloat for the in game store. And imagine using emotes... like above the head of those little dudes... would make the game feel more alive... but that could just be me...

 But I still definitely recommend the game despite all the above and the game having very few minigames so far (as of release you will cycle through all of them in a couple of hours multiple times).

Recommend because:
- Casual fun / relaxing (except if you start getting tired of team minigames ruining your runs)
- More often than not it is hilarious.
- I have a feeling they will be improving on the game a lot so there is that since the devs are very communicative and showed that they care about their playerbase (noticeable by how they dealt with the server issues on launch). 

Looking forward to coming back to the game when they add more maps and/or separate team minigames from single player games. Also more stuff in the store since its quite fun to customize your chubby little guy. I hope they add emotes too and a chat. 

tl;dr: Game can be hilarious and fun for dozens of hours if you don't care about team minigames mixed with single player minigames on elimination rounds, lack of chat, and very few minigames that will repeat often.",False

"So much raging chaos, so much fun.

Well,  after some time in the game, I want to give you more then one random sentence for a  review. Fall Guy is a game, that pits around 60 players in a series of minigames designed to elimate them over serveral rounds until there is a single player claiming the crown as the winner.

The fun I have in this game depends massively on the type of mini-game and the fellow players/competitors. At its best, I have tremendous fun in mini-games, where the outcome is mainly determined by my correct assessment of the game situation and well... how good I smash the right buttons on my gamepad. At its worst, you are trapped in one of the notorious bottlenecks on a map, that every player has to get through to have any hope of surviving the round. I don't mind a little bit randomness, but sometimes you just feel caught in a situation you have to endure and wait out.

And there are team games. Oh boy, where to start. They CAN be fun. But in many cases, it is a mixture of desperation und frustration. You can't communicate with your teammates (if we ignore the cosmetic emotes). Premade teams will have a  advantage in smaller teams. Often, teams are unequal in the number of players. This factors often result in the stomping of one team and it can get worse in rounds with 3 teams. Team games that are decided just before time runs out are a lot of fun, but in the minorty.

Nonetheless, Fall Guys can be a great game which offers awesome customization options for your player character and a unique, emotional roller coaster not seen in many other games. I'm really curious how the existing mini-games will be improved and what new ones will come.

A word of warning so: At the moment, there seems to be a growing problem of cheaters in this game, but I am positiv, that the developers can minimize that issue in the future.",True

[b] Pros; [/b]
[olist]
[*]Ability to play with others offers a good opportunity opening a window for lots more fun.

[*]The mini games are fun and colourful, well thought out and easy to understand. 

[*]The ability to customise characters is already quite good for a game of this type, fantastic that you can earn all currencies in-game and it does not 'force' you to buy currencies, even though the option is there.

[*]The 'season' type levelling system is similar to that seen of in other 'battle royale' games, Because the level of your character resets each season, and new rewards are available, this allows for more motivation to play the game and also for new players to join in and not feel pushed out by humongous level gaps (for example in a game like 'Overwatch', they display everyone's level and in a lot of cases people who are a lower level are bullied)
[/olist]
[b] Cons/ areas for improvement; [/b]
[olist]
[*]Randomisation of the mini-games could be improved, for example you could get the same game combination multiple times in a row, to combat this they could add new mini-games, or make slight twists on already existing levels, for example different patterns for doors opening, or different pathways.

[*]The servers are slightly struggling currently, which is understandable for such a game company, and they are working on this but it can be frustrating to be kicked out of multiple games.

[*]New levels are going to need to be kept on top of to create a level playing-field, as people play the current mini games more and more they will find 'shortcuts' and easy routes to finish it as quickly as possible, taking away the fun-factor for everyone. New players will find it difficult to catch up and enthusiasts will become disinterested. A rotation of mini games per season could also combat this.

"Neat premise. The physics are hard enough to get under control with so many other players bouncing around the place that it can be an entertaining challenge to qualify for a round.

I'm sure it's a form of entertainment for some, but I just can't stand it.

[b]Edit:[/b] There are a lot of irritating little quirks still present, such as the awful camera boundaries, the still missing player names, occasional cheaters, etc. I continue playing this game simply to spend time with friends and witness them suffer just as much as me (if not moreso). Although I have gotten significantly better since my original post, it's still exceedingly frequent that my character falls over or cannot recover from a jump for no discernible reason, or that the lobby crashes and fails to deliver my hard earned crown.

"Let's begin with the things that I like about Fall Guys:

• The overall adorableness of the game brings me joy, hearing the little beans make their noises, their wonky walking animations and their wacky costumes.

• The game feels very challenging, which is a great thing for a game like this, perfect for players who want to endure a challenge. But then again, there are lots of things that can make the experience a little tainted, refer to the cons that I listed.

• The variety between outfits is very pleasing to me, with outfits ranging from a pigeon, to a dinosaur, to a carton of fries, there's definitely an outfit for everybody.

• This game definitely has a lot of potential, and will not be a game that I delete anytime soon. It's a genre-defining experience and should definitely be played by people who are fans of party-style games of the likes of Mario Party.

Next, let's dive into the cons, and why I think they're a negative aspect to the game:

• First off, the 'team' games completely just suck in general. Unfair pairing with teammates who do nothing to help your team win, always losing at team games is simply annoying just because there's one or more people just messing around and not going for the objective. I'm talking primarily about Fall Ball, which in my opinion is one of the most frustrating mini-games in the game. Teammates just give up not even 30 seconds into it and nobody protects the goal, purely a rage fest.

• Second, the final round almost always being Fall Mountain is just annoying, too. I'm tired of losing to someone who uses speed hacks, or just because a conveniently-placed ball lands on me and just flings me all the way back to the start of the map. I'd prefer Hex-A-Gone or something that isn't Fall Mountain.

• Next, the grabbers who just camp at the finish line of the race mini-games should definitely be punished in some sort of way. Literally just sitting there waiting for people to come by so they can make them potentially lose is really toxic and shouldn't go unpunished.

• Finally, leaving a game when your teammates aren't doing anything to benefit the team shouldn't mean you don't get experience for that match just because you left. There should be a general disclaimer before you exit telling you no experience will be earned from the match, or just let people get the experience they earned up until the forfeit. 

Some stuff I'd like to see be introduced to this game would definitely be:

• More mini-games, because if you play like 3 full matches you have a huge change of experiencing the entirety of Fall Guys. Plus the variety would be much appreciated.

• Voting on mini-games, because it gets boring playing the same final mini-game every single match, this would definitely benefit everybody if this were a feature.

• Holiday-themed cosmetics and other general cosmetics, because festive outfits are awesome. I know that there are no holidays yet that have passed since Fall Guys has been out, but I assume they'll be doing stuff for Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc, like a turkey outfit for Thanksgiving or a ghost outfit for Halloween, who knows? Also, titles and stuff like that would be awesome. Player cards, player emblems, etc.

My overall view on this game is aiming towards positive, and for the price, you can't go wrong with it. Fall Guys is the latest trend that definitely deserves the recognition it has been receiving by the loads of brands that have been pitching their thoughts of the game as of recently.

"Although constantly getting bumped over by other players can be frustrating, Fall guys provides high smileage-per-hour, even playing solo. If you enjoyed watching Takeshi's Castle growing up and always pictured yourself as a competitor; this game absolutely fulfils that fantasy.

My only complaints are:
- The lack of any 21:9 support whatsoever is absolutely shocking for a PC game in this day and age.
- Overall, given the current value this game offers at launch, I would say Fall Guys should have probably been priced 25% cheaper than it is (or could have even made a fantastic F2P game with MTX).
 
With that said, with how the popularity of this game has absolutely exploded; I am incredibly optimistic for the growth of this title, and am happy to support what Mediatonic and Devolver have released; especially given what an incredible breath of fresh air is on offer.

Thumbs up, and hoping they bring local split-screen down the road.",True

"Fall Guys is an amazing combination of game shows, ROBLOX minigames, and battle royales. There are a plethora of modes to play and all of them are just as much fun to replay. The feeling of being in a competition to the end against 60 other people or having to work together with your team to bully the other teams gives a rush that can't really be found in other games.

The game's server maintenance the last day or so has been poor, but that is to be expected with a game becoming huge out of nowhere, they weren't prepared for this. Right now, the game is in a 90% playable state. (The servers occasionally time out)


It doesn't seem like the kind of game that will stay populated forever, so buy it now while it's hot off the grill, the experiences achievable at the time of this review will probably not stay the same within a few months or so.",True
"Actually pretty fun in the beginning, but gets boring really fast, due to the lack of maps and the fact, that 90% of this game is just pure luck... Definetely not worth the 20€.",False
"This game is a lot of fun, regardless of whether you play Solo or with friends. I have recommended it to several of my friends, and they have bought the game and enjoyed it as much as I have. I would recommend this for streamers and non-streamers, alike.",True
"I would definitely give this game a try if you're into simple physics based multiplayer directed chaos. The controls are easy to learn, and the game-play is on par with most outrageous party games. Your party size can be as large as 4 and that's the best way to experience Fall Guys. Although solo has its merits as well. 

The best parts of the game so far include: the fun in mastering the mechanics and the maps. Customization feels satisfying and rewarding. When playing with friends it can be one of the best party games currently on the market. The games are fast and the queue times are short.  

As for its shortcomings, the game lacks variety near the final few stages of an ""Episode"". There is some fairly weak net-code and you will often feel like you shouldn't have been grabbed when you were. The RNG in terms of starting placement and team-based games can feel infuriating at times, however when it's on your side it feels great (no duh). 

Fall Guys has a fantastic platform to explode from, and if handled well will become one of my favourite simplistic games. They have had an exhaustive first week of launching between server issues, HTML name editing, and connectivity hiccups but don't let that alone deter you. I am excited to see what's in store once they start rolling out more content.",True

"[h1] Fall Guys Burgers 'n Fries review [/h1]

Right so, Let me state very blatantly, I don't watch twitch. I don't care for whatever whiplash or anger you may feel towards the game there. It's none of my business. 

[b] Short summary [/b] 

Fall guys is a well produced PC game, that you may see on the mobile market. A lack of musical variety, maps, and lack of customization leaves the desire for something more. Well it is made right, this feels like something I'd see before the release, not something at release. 

[h1] Long Summary [/h1]

[b] Below will cover all my grips with the game in the most explicit mannerism possible. [/b]

[h1] Customization and how to keep a player going [/h1]

Fall guys is a game, in which you run from point A to point B. Sometimes this falls in between, what is important, is that you [i] enjoy [/i] the game. Fall guys, is very enjoyable. I had a lot of fun. But the more I played it, the more it dawned on me how empty the game is for what it really is. Vivid color schemes, bright and cheerful characters, and goofy levels mask this heavily, but the game is very... Baron when you get down to it. Customization for example, you have the option of your face, which is [i] only [/i] to change the color of your face, Your color scheme (which must be bought to some capacity or earned in the ""Free seasonal pass"") Your pattern, Upper body outfit, and lower body outfit. This isn't a shooter. I don't expect a lot of customization, but the fact of the matter is, at the end of the day to look slightly cool, or. Anywhat interesting, you have to either A: Only use Patterns, colors, and Faces, or B: Use only Upper, Lower, and color. You can use all 5 of these on very, certain, outfits. But that's such a niche that it's stretching it. 

Point being, the goal you're working towards in Fall Guys to keep you playing, is to get outfits. Outfits are so very limited in what they cosmetically show (limiting other items) that, is it really worth working towards? Another thing, DLC. This game launched Day 1 with DLC. Call me wrong, but that seems scummy. $15 in DLC total USD, may be a small price to pay, but that's nearly... 3/4th's the games price? Seems a bit dumb. 

[h1] Mechanics / Levels [/h1]

Fall guys is a game that relies on you, and 60 other people playing and slowly, the 60 other people fail, fall, and ""die"" or, rather get knocked out of the game. It's like Wipeout, a series you may have seen on TV a long time ago. It's a fun concept, and generally, cool! What's the problem then? Well. There's a lack of unique levels. Levels repeat, challenges are the same, you may suck at one thing, and that will be the only variant of it. The game will only give you so limited options, that it almost leaves the desire for RNG made levels. While a cute game, with some fun levels, I don't have fun playing on the same map 20 times, just to ""oh no, I lost."" Or ""Oh yay, I won."" Because again, at the end of the day I'm working towards limited cosmetics that ultimately, mean nothing to me. Playing the same level over and over will lead you to insanity, playing against random people will lead you to insanity because, I can't even talk to these people, hang out with them on steam, or make buddies with them and play something else. I can only grab them, have them grab me, and then we both jump into the finish line only to forget the other guy existed next round.

Lets jump into the Battle Royale aspect huh? Well, this game supports 60 players. If players are knocked out, at the end screen they'll be replaced by a big red square after they're ejected. This means they were eliminated, Or stayed and watched. (I'm thinking a mixture of both.) However sometimes at the end of the first round, only 15 people of 30 may be eliminated, meaning there was still another 15 left who never showed up. What happened? 15 players disconnected, you never get to see their models fall, or know they existed. You just see a blue square of an empty player slot. It's disappointing. My main overarching issue is, interactivity. I have no way to directly affect other people, other than bumping into them or grabbing them. I can't later on after ""death"" shoot a dodge ball at them via off map cannons. I can't write ""lol this is fun"" to them. I can't do anything. I just exist. A mere obstacle in their way.

What I feel the game needs is something to encourage people to spectate, like lets say throwing dodge balls off map, or being in control of certain parts of the map. (Control over fans spinning or something) This would lead to more fun, random spectacles but currently its just, repeat spins. Repeat walk with no real threat. It's kinda... Tedious after a while. There's no reason to stay and spectate because, you don't get rewarded for spectating. You just exist and ""oh they won, good for them."" All the joy of a battle royale being, people watching, is usually lost in video games because, no one stays and watches. They earn nothing, by watching you. So why bother? You can't blame them either. Again, it almost leaves you wanting more, more player interactivity, more people to interact with, more friends to have. Some way, to directly communicate with the people, flailing about with you. But you can't. And they can't interact with you. I think to me, that's what ultimately bogs this game down the most. The fun, zany people you'll meet in it, are just that. Fun, zany, people. You'll never see them again, never form a bond with them. That was it.

[h1] Music and how to turn a man insane [/h1] 

Your game might suffer a few issues when the biggest issue of it is having only 2 tracks. When I heard the track for the trailer of this game, I expected a fun, happy music score. Instead that track you heard in the trailer? It's the [b] ONLY SONG THEY HAVE IN THE WHOLE GAME THAT PLAYS DURING THE BR. [/b] It's mind blowing this got through like this to me.  There's a main menu theme but that'll drive you insane to. In order to enjoy the game, you have to bring your own music, and if you don't know any good music, you're sorta f*cked lol. I think that's just. Scummy. Really, They should have more than definitely paid their artist more to make more tracks, or had more. What we end up with in this game is disappointing. there's no variety. 

[h1] Overall consensus to me. [/h1] 

I think Fall guys is another twitch game. (Irony compared to my first statement.) I think it's fun, appears fun, and can easily dupe the player into buying it, but ultimately is after your wallet. The only guy falling, is you. Falling into trap, that takes your wallet. The fact there's ""In game currency"" I can buy, should tell you this is a game that'd normally appear on the mobile market. So what such a product is doing here on PC? I don't know. What it does well, it isn't built on or put into action correctly, it comes off as another title eagerly rushed out in the modern age with no compassion put into the work, more than compassion put into stealing your wallet.

I hope everyone who has read this far takes genuine care to avoid games like this in the future, and even though I'll rate it up because, it's still a semi fun game, for what time you put into it, It's ultimately something that's boring without people to communicate to, spend time with, or a community to interact with. And no, I'm not going to reddit to beggar for friends.",True

"[h1] TL;DR: DONT BUY THE GAME YET [/h1]

Let me just get everything bad out of the way then get into more detail. The worst part about it is the fact that their servers DONT EVEN WORK, your names WONT SHOW UP, and if you try to complain they'll try to CENSOR YOUR OPINIONS (mostly on their official discord).

In terms of the server, server downtime is expected and that's not the problem. The problem is how poorly they're taking it. They keep turning it on and off then COMPLAIN about people trying to join, rather than turning matchmaking off and fixing it in one go.

The name issue is very similar. They completely turned off names rather than just trying to fix it. Their problem was that people were joining with bad names, so they just straight up removed them.

Mods in their discord are ramping up the slowmode just so people cant talk about how everything's being dealt with poorly, and they arent allowing us to talk about their servers.

"Big yes.

One of the little gems of videogaming in general. It's super easy to pickup, super charming and highly addictive.
It's not perfect as of now (right after launch): the developers are becing victim of their success and have to find the right server capacity to handle the massive influx of people but that also means potentially a big and long lasting community.

Time will tell how the game evolves season after season (they seem to last 60 days-ish). I'd be fine if just new games were swapped in and out and new cosmetics were introduced but if we can get surprising stuff like new types of gameplay that would be neat.",True

"This is like Takeshi's Castle but cuter. You will fall over a lot. You will bounce off stuff a lot. You will still want to come back for more. HOWEVER if you have high ping where you live eg South Africa, be aware some of the team games become pretty unplayable (looking at you tail grab). They aren't every round, and because the whole game is over so quickly I personally can overlook this, but if this makes you really angry maybe skip this game. 
ALSO at the time of writing, server capacity is not keeping up with amount of players. I'm sure this is something that will get fixed, but as of right now, you may get some connection issues.

Pros
+ great for quick pick-up-and-play style rounds, if you've only got 10 minutes you can still play
+ bright, colourful level and character graphics
+ good for gamers with any level of experience
+ levels that are so fun and silly you may actually laugh out loud
+ can group up with friends
+ even if you get eliminated in the first round, you still get some progression points (ie you can still earn points to spend in the outfit shop even if you're not very good at the game). This lets you take part in every part of the game, regardless of how good you are.

Cons
- Outfit shop is rotating. I'd rather they just show me what all the options are and let me pick at my leisure. 
- When spectating (after you've been eliminated, but a friend you'd joined with is still playing), the camera does not automatically go to your group mate. You spend more time trying to find them than watching them play.
- Other players will grab you or push you, which is part of the game but can be very frustrating. May put some players off.

Overall, as frustrating as other players sabotaging you can be, I still think this game is just so much silly fun that's it's worth a play. Definitely happy with my purchase.",True

pog game,True
"Okay, so I do like this game, and I won't talk about the server issues and matchmaking issues since it wouldn't be fair to the developers. I am on the fence whether or not I should truly recommend this game, however, I will give it a thumbs up for now in hopes that it will change at some point. I find the game fun in its current state, with two exceptions. Team games and the memory match game. The memory match game is just so boring and I feel as if it is just a time waste as opposed to any sort of real fun. The whole game is just looking at the ground panels and then when the time runs out looking at the big screen to see which panel, labelled with fruits, you need to jump on. With so many people, it's never a problem to find which panel to step on, so losing is fairly difficult. There's no skill needed and it more or less just feels rushed into the game as an extra mini-game. Now, my biggest issue with the game: team games. Team games are incredibly unbalanced and not fun. Team games are just a random mishmash of people put into 2-4 teams fighting to not get eliminated, and sometimes the teams can be imbalanced. One team could have 9 people with the other has 10. One person could AFK during the team match, leaving that team at a disadvantage. People with differing skills is also another issue. One team could get all the 'try-hards' and people who know the game better, while the other team just gets filled with 'casual' players and people just there to fill air. I don't like intentionally having to try so hard to win, especially when the game gives such push back. To remedy this whole team game issue, the team games should just be put in a different section with brand new mini-games. That way, the people who actually enjoy the team-based games get to play them, while the people who truly dislike them, and every person I've played with has said something negative about team games, do not have to worry about getting lucky. Otherwise, I do find the game fun and enjoyable, aside from the couple of bumps and hiccups. As of its state right now, I'd probably give it a 7.9/10. Too many team games.",True

Bugs:
- Physics are sometimes janky

- Speed hackers

Other than that there are multiple things that could easily be improved:
- Let people disconnect a game during loading screen (especially after one lost the round)
- Fast switch to spectate party members
- Highlight party members in score screen

What they did ""fix"":
Since it was possible to use control sequences in your Steam name to change size and color of your name in the score screen, now every player is named ""Fall Guy XYZ"". No way to tell where your party members are. No way to show off in front of others, since they do not see your name. No way to report other players.

"In this review, I'll first give my honest opinion about the game, how my first experience were and then I'll talk about the thing everyone is talking about.

So, the game. One big question: Did I enjoy it so far?
Yes. Simple as that.
It's basically a collection of fun and quick mini games packed into an enjoyable competitive format.
When I first saw this game I had one thought in my head ""Is this....is this Takeshi's Castle?"".
Now after playing I can say, yes it is, and damn it's a ton of fun.
If I have to pick a negative thought about the gameplay, it would be that it's just too addictive.
Restarting after being eliminated is just a few quick button presses away and you're back in, ready to go, trying to grab yourself that win!
The rounds are over super fast, you don't even notice how much time is passing, being eliminated is not frustrating because it feels like you've just lost one small mini game and that's it. It doesn't take half an hour to get back to where you were, just a couple of minutes later you'll be fighting for the win again.
Thanks to the quick mechanic it never felt like I've wasted my time when I failed, and that happened often enough.
In the short window I had to play the game I even managed to get myself to one victory, ended a few race games in first place, had fun interactions at the finish line with random people, played with friends, made new enemies, had a lot of fun and not for once second was I frustrated for not winning a game.

But speaking of short window I had to play, lets talk about the big thing everyone is talking about - server stability.

There's a clear warning about server issues on the store page, and some people just ignore it to complain about it 5 minutes later, but, lets look at the issue.

I understand why people are upset, their launch has a lot of server problems.
But what a lot of people don't seem to understand is one simple thing about server:
Fixing server issues is not as simple as flipping a switch and turning on a couple more server or upgrading some hardware.
It's a ton of work to get things like that up and running to perform as stable as people would like them to.
And here's the next tiny oversight some people might have, we aren't talking about some big AAA game, we are talking about Devolver Digital and Mediatonic.
A small 20 people strong publisher team that has brought so many amazing games to life and, compared to other players in the multiplayer market, small dev team of just over 200 people.


I'm not saying that the launch was something that should be ignored, because it shouldn't. But it should be discussed in a form that's not just calling Devolver Digital out on how bad the launch was, but to actually try and understand what went wrong.
There's always the argument of ""look at big AAA game launches, did their server run without problem?"" and most of the time, the answer to that is ""no"".
Because preparing a multiplayer game is not a simple task.

So in conclusion, would I recommend this game?
Yes. It's fun and addictive.
If you're a fan of action packed mini games, buy it.

Should you wait before you buy the game?
Totally. Wait it out, give it a few days, let them work out the server issues and when the warning on the store page is gone, buy the game.",True

This game is super captivating and oddly addicting, there are a few things this game could use but overall it is worth it for a fun time with friends.

List of problems:
#1: Party system: There needs to be an option for more than 4 in a party. Playing with friends is hard when you have to limit your group, and with no custom lobbies, this is an even harder task. 
#2: Lack of maps: This game is so fun and the map design is fun, however this game will need more maps soon to keep its momentum. 
#3: Servers: The servers are unstable with multiple disconnects happening in every play session. Hopefully this will be fixed but being kicked right before the final round is demoralizing and leads to me giving up playing for the day.

"Fall Guys is an amazing idea for a competitive ""race to the finish"" styled game. The games are enjoyable and the art direction is pretty hilarious. I have spent hours playing this game in my spare time already.

The server issues will definitely take some time to figure out, but hey, that's what happens when your game is much more successful than you had thought it would be. Servers are overloaded because of the high amount of traffic.. People who complain about this are literally the bane of any developers existence and should disregarded immediately, as they are not the least bit credible. 

Now, to the BAD stuff. DEVELOPERS, please take this into consideration. 

- Team games are trash. The other day, there were 9 of us left in the game. The chosen was soccer, leaving the teams unbalanced at 5 vs 4. We immediately stood no chance. Soccer should never be the chosen game unless there are an even amount of players. 

- Once again, team games are trash lol. While they could be enjoyable in their own mode, losing the game because you are stuck on a team with griefers or people who literally haven't the slightest clue of what they are doing is rather disappointing. Honestly, it's enough to make me quit the game often. Consider making team games separate from the main game mode. The free for all aspect of this game is what makes it fun. NOT working alongside members which you will eventually take out if you are able to survive long enough. 

- The logic game.. a complete and total waste of time. Not only is this mode boring, but the most players I have ever seen eliminated were 5. On the average, I see 1-3 players eliminated. This mode honestly comes off as a filler mode.. something to just take up space and in my opinion, should be deleted completely.

So, all in all Fall Guys is a great game. It's super enjoyable and a blast to play with friends. With some tweaks, this game could become one of my favorite games. Give it a try, I'm sure you'll have a great time. Congrats to the Devs for a job well done.",True

"Extremely fun for the first hour. Had me lauging really loud, it is silly asf. 

Pros: 

-Sound effects are great (tetrisish) 
-Cosmetics are awesome, There are a great variety of customisation options, even with the default ones (free)
-Art style is cute, quirky and fun
-There is some RNG with the team matches, but it is acceptable

Cons:

-The issue is that it gets repetitive very fast. You play the same maps over and over. If the maps were randomly generated or they just simply designed more maps, it would be a fun experience for the hours to come.

Right now i am torn between keeping the game and refunding it. Or it might just be a better idea to purchase to game at a later date when they have released more maps and cosmetics if you are into that sort stuff.

"I love the game.  I played a stupid amount of the beta but from what I've seen, it's just not ready.

They have mentioned more games will come out with each season with is currently 59 more days at time of writing.  The limited games they have will feel stale after just a few sessions.

Most games feel SUPER stale once you learn them.  Once you learn the maps you can pretty much promise yourself a spot in the next round if you know the patterns of each course.  There needs to be RNG elements in every race to level the playing field for new and veteran players.

It is also worth noting that many of the screenshots on the store page are from very early development and most do not match what the game looks like and a few are from games that are simply not even in the game.

Like others have said, the team games are garbage and can leave you not wanting to play again if you did everything in your power to help your team.  The finals (looking at you fall mountain) are frustrating if you don't start near the front.

TLDR:
Needs more content or needs to be free.  Wait.",False

"The game is really fun, but their are a few problems.

Of course now and a again you get disconnected, but that has mostly been fixed.

On Hoopsie Daisy, the ramps in the backsides of the map are broken, I repeatably see people glitch through them, even if they aren't doing it on their screen, it still is a bug that effects gameplay, as their hitbox still seems to move around.

I don't how this one could be fixed, but it needs mentioning. The fact that I have had PERFECT games on Fall Mountain, but because I spawned in the back, I lost, it was an 18 player Fall mountain, so I was in the 4th row with 2 others, I didnt hit any balls, walls, or hammers, but because I was in the back at the start somebody, that messed up on the hammers beat me. I was the one that had a perfect game, but because I had a disadvantage going in, I lost, not to mention I was first place on the game right before it, which was Tip Toe, I don't know how to fix this but it is very annoying to play perfectly, but lose to somebody that messed up.",True

This game is fun. Whatever kinks are in the game will be getting fixed in the near term I believe. Gamplay reminds me of a mobile game - quick and easy (but still challenging) and in short bursts. The complaints about the server issues are def real right now so keep that in mind.,True
"I have seen drop from ""very positive"" to ""mostly positive"" in just two days. 
If I can give a rating instead of just stating whether I recommend the game, I would give it a solid 3 out of 5. The game play is nothing exceptional, but the graphical design is pretty cute while not demanding hi-end hardware, and the music is pretty good--very suitable for the game play in my opinion. But the most important thing is that, it is fun. Yes, it is not as competitive as games like CS:GO, nor as elegant as games like Ori. But sometimes, all a game needs is to be fun. Fall Guys is one of these games--it is not like a piece of art, nor a sport, but simply a game. And I would say, there is not a lot of places in life where I can spent just a few bucks to get as much fun as what I have obtained from this game. 
However, I am not giving it a five out of five mainly because of two reasons. 
First, although I had had a whole lot of fun in my meager 13 hours of play time, the fun that I get while playing have significantly decreased after I have gotten used to pretty much all of the few maps. Also, after getting the first crown, I stop feeling as accomplished as I get more and more crowns. Fall Guys attempts to fuse e-sports with a casual game play, and it resulted in a chimera that is neither an e-sports title, nor a casual game. The battleground playstyle limits the interactivity typical in casual games, while the simple gameplay limits the diminishes its competitive nature. While I can easily see myself throw a few more hours into this game, I would estimate that the fun will die out before 50 hours if no new content is released; while a game like Dota can attract my interest for thousands of hours. 
The second problem lies in the servers. In the three days since I have bought it, I was not able to connect to matchmaking in over half of the instances where I have logged in and prepared to play a bit. Today, the server has been in maintenance for almost 12 hours, and after a mere 2 hours of gameplay I was unable to connect to matchmaking again. I have also been kicked out of a game for uncounted times because of disconnection from the server. This is obviously not just my problem since many people have been complaining. Although I don't want to demerit a game for its server since it is not a part of the game's content, the server stability is an important part of a game's experience, and the server quality has rendered Fall Guys almost unplayable. I would say that ironically, Fall Guys' servers are consistent in that they never work properly.

And so, in the end, although I appreciate this game and give it a overall pass, I am not recommending anyone to buy this game at this time. I would recommend anyone who have any interest to at least wait until the publisher fixes most server issues, and I think that it would probably be wise to also wait a little while and see if the developers are trying to create any new game modes or content to keep the game fresh.",False

"Talk about suffering from success. The game is more popular than it was supposed to be which leads to the most understandable server issues for any game ever. This isn't a Rockstar game, where the servers are overloaded from poor planning. It's a shame that this game has only 77% positive reviews considering how much fun the game is when it's working. Normally I would withhold my own positive upvote for the developers to actually fix the problem, but I think the backlash is much too extreme for the crime. Given time, I think this game is gonna be great. If the server issues are never fixed, I'll come back to this review.

"Game is plagued by constant server issues and extremely long loading times even when the game servers are functional. This renders your game time to a split of 75% waiting and 25% playing the actual game. If you want to move away from server critiques and as such when it comes to game play this game can be very fun at times with its quirky art style and mostly fun game modes. Now the actual game modes are where a large portion of this game falls apart. Majority of the team events need to be scrapped and never utilised again as they make for frustrating game play even when you are on the winning team. Team events such as tail chase push the ball, jump through the hoops feel intentionally unsatisfying compared to solo race or jumping tracks as there is an element of luck involved in each and everyone of these courses. For example where the hoops spawn during the hoop jump game mode or if you spawn right at the back in a race for the crown completely ruining your chances of even getting close to winning. For the moment i would stray away from buying this game until the devs have first and fore most fixed the HUGE server issues and secondly completely scrapped team game modes in favour of more fun skill based solo courses.",False

Fall Guys is good but in small bursts.

It's a wacky game with some unpredictable results. It can be a mix of funny and frustrating. The game's popularity definitely feels finite but I don't know what the devs have in store.

Players couldn't find a game, they disconnected randomly, random lag spikes, and CHEATERS! And the moderators on Discord are just unhelpful, they kept telling the impatient players to be patient and appreciate the dev team. They even blamed players for their complaints and made it like it's players' fault that the servers had issues. I feel they tried to manage the community like a cult, disgusting. For example, a player said there were speed hackers, and the moderator replied ""Not everyone cheats."" WTF is this reply?!",False

Infested with cheaters, in every game.",False
"Going to change my review because I've actually managed to play a decent amount of games with no server issues, so I'm guessing they've fixed the problem on their ends.

I'm gonna go right off the bat and say that Fall Guys is repetitive. after an hour or so of playing, I've managed to get the same 3-4 things over and over again, maybe with the exception of one stage. I don't know if it's just my shit luck getting these same things constantly, but it does get bothersome.

Second of all, some stages need revamping. Lots of it. There are times where you're trying to shove 30 something people on a small ass platform that can hold less. Then at that point it's more ""I hope I don't fall off"" than ""I'm going to TRY not to fall off"".

With that said, though, the game is still fun. Playing game after game of obstacle courses and whatnot does get repetitive sometimes, but being in the lead does give a feeling of accomplishment, which makes it somewhat worth. I haven't had the privilege of playing with friends, so I can imagine what it's like to help/dick them over.

Overall, it's a pretty fun game if you just need a time-killer. I'd recommend waiting a bit so that they add some more content to enjoy, but if you're dead set on getting it, or if your friends are all playing it, then it's worth playing.",True
very fun,True
cool,True
"The game is fun, a lot of fun actually. Unfortunately in its current state is difficult to recommend due to the vast amount of server issues that have been present since launch. I'm sure that eventually they will fix the issues and there will be a consistent, fun experience. Hopefully that happens before the playerbase gets fed up and leaves for something else.

Edit 9/11: never forgetti, in the games current state I still can't recommend it. Since reaching max level in the battlepass I don't find the urge to play this game. Not because I got bored with the gameplay, it's just as fun as ever. The cheating problem has gotten out of hand, and it's not worth slugging through an episode that you have no chance of winning. They're supposed to be implementing Easy AntiCheat or something in the next couple weeks (not sure why it would take that long to implement) so we'll see how it does then.",False

"Some people have complained that there are not enough levels and that repetition quickly sets in. I think the real issues are that some levels only seem to happen with specific player counts and that there are only a couple specific final levels. 

I think the game would benefit from any level being able to happen in any order. 

That way, from the very beginning, a player would always have a chance to play the level they liked the most. Some variants of the same level might be needed so the levels don't appear overcrowded or empty. This would also relieve some irritation from the team levels; since currently other people on your team can prevent you from reaching a level you like. 

While having a fairly consistent first, second, and third act makes sense for a tv show; I do not believe it is necessary for this video game. I think it just creates repetition.",False

Yes there may be a fair amount of repitition from the map pool, but it gives you a chance to work our strategies for it the game! It's repetitive in the same way any battle royal is repetitive.

As it stands the pros:

- Cute little jellybean sprites that are hilarious to watch stumble around
- Graphics overall are good
- A good amount of customization so far, doesn't seem tough to earn the in-game money overall or level up
- Fun levels (for the most part) 
- Generally more stable servers (for the most part - still needs some work)
- Easy going menu, fun music, great simple party game
- Quick overall game play, snap in and out of games - each total game has 5 rounds making this relatively easy to pick up for a quick match
- Overall good party game, easy join from friends on steam without issue
- The game is relaxing and frustrating - but definitely not as HARDCORE IM AN ELITE TWITCH STREAMER BR BR BR type of game which is a nice change of pace. 

The Could be Improved (not going to say CONS - because I believe this game could be a fantastic game):

- Some levels are a bit too short or mundane, not saying remove them merely hope the devs think about that in the future
- The ""Fall Ball"" map needs sharper controls to hit the balls, somewhat janky hits, would be more fun with crisp fast controls - this map frustrates the heck out of me, but I accept I have to adapt to it
- The game shouldn't force us to play a team map every round, sometimes fine, sometimes I should be all solo - randomize
- We need more maps, I know its new, but the game does get on a rotation of the same maps which can get boring
- Cosmetics - if we are going to have tiers (in game money vs winner money), at least make the crown ones (obtained by winning) not cost you 5 wins, but 1 - some folks will never win this, and at least allowing folks to attain a crown through battle pass and get something nice would seem more fair. 
- Make the screens between maps quicker, I feel like I am constantly sitting on load screens to watch people fall off the board, not bad, but maybe speed it up
- Connectivity issues - not going to bash it as it came out and I don't think the devs got a grasp on how interested people were in this - ive had a few drops in game, or a few issues connecting to games - I assume they're working on it but ill mention it. 

All in all I hope Devolver and Mediatonic turn this into a beast that grows like Rocket League or other games!",True

"This game is good light-hearted fun, however, some of the maps/minigames could do with some changes. coming into the final there is only really one map/game that gives each player a fair chance, when it comes to the others it seems to be more about luck. The game could do with some extra maps/games too as most of the time i find myself playing the same 6 or 7. Team games also suck the enjoyment out for me, your goal in this game is to work against everyone to win, so playing with a team doesnt really make sense, as in the next game theyre back to being your opponents. im sure many players like it, its just not for me. The game overall is fun though and very easy to jump into. 7/10",True

Some trouble with servers on startup, but the devs have steadily improved them in the last two days.

Currently the content is a bit sparse, but the nature of the game makes it very easy to expand on maps in the near future (which the devs have already planned), so I look forward to that.

So when this game came out I was a little wary as I just don't have the time to commit.  Thankfully this game isn't all about the commitment, I can jump in, do a few games and come back out again.  Perfect!

I knew the moment my first level was ""run through the doors, some are fake"" and I saw about ten people go crashing into a fake door that this game would be a right giggle.   And it is.   I love seeing what cute little outfits people have on and currently I am a rainbow tutu wearing t-rex.

"Fun game, but needs some improvements.

Release Day:

- I think there should be a separate playlist for the team games because they take a lot of fun out of the game. It feels like you don't really have any impact on the outcome. 

- If you're playing with friends and you get knocked out then it should automatically spectate your friend. 

- Needs a borderless windowed option. 

I think they would be some quality of life changes that would make the game even more enjoyable.

UPDATE:25/08/20

- Physics are awful, full of trolls who just grab.
- Hackers Ruining games.
- Not getting rewards even after logging back in.
- Team Games utterly ruin the fun of this game.
- Customer service is trash.

,True
"EDIT: I like the game, but I'm  going to have to change my review from recommended to NOT RECOMMENDED. 

Reason: 1 word, CHEATERS. It was bad enough when the cheating started when cheaters get to the finish line with their speed hacks seconds after the round starts. Then they started deliberately eliminating people, grabbing and pushing since they know they can save themselves by flying. It honestly ruins the game for a lot of people.

The Devs say they have implemented something to address this. But I see no improvements. It just became worse. From rarely encountering a single cheater in a game. To outright multiples of them in a single game.

There are also several issues with the game right now. De-sync being the cause of so much frustration. People can grab your tail from a mile away while you can't even get a tail even though you've grabbed the player multiple times. You can't push balls properly as you'll glitch through them. Glitching through walls. Your character suddenly slips while you are peacefully walking and no one close enough who could have bumped into you. Server disconnections. The list goes on..

OLD REVIEW:
Really fun to play especially with friends. Would like to see more game variety in the future and hopefully bigger team size. A lot of my friends play this game and we wan't to play together but the team size is kind of a limiting factor. I mean yes, we could probably hit play at the same time but it isn't a guarantee that we'll all be in the same game room.",False

"Great game, very fun, very big yes. go buy now!",True
"Closest thing to online Mario party I've ever played. More game modes and obstacle courses would be great but I'm sure that's all coming later considering the game has a season system like most popular live service type games. Overall pretty good, and you unlock the in game currency at a pretty good rate, could be a tad better but it's all dependent on how many people are in the match + the round you make it too. Overall 4/5 that will only get better when more courses and variety are added",True

"Review Update

Originally i already reviewed it within this game's first launch week. Then, i didn't recommend the game simply because of server issues and little content. So, how's the game has been since then and how's the developer handling this game so far?

While there's now slightly more content in terms of cosmetic and the upcoming Season 2 which will brings new modes and stuff, the rest of the game is still a buggy mess. In fact, there's more problem now than it was.

- Cheaters running rampant because there's no anti cheat measurement to this day yet
- In game name is disabled completely and everyone get some generic number instead because afaik the dev aren't competent enough to implement basic name filter to blocked inappropriate, weird names and fonts
- Server is still having issues to this day
- Some game mode is still indeed trash
- Menu still is sluggish
- Patch notes only fix some bugs and added QoL improvement that should've been in the game in the first place, while there's still no news regarding the other major issues.

The devs handle feedbacks very slowly and poorly so far. Honestly, the only hope left at this point is that the dev would finally hire some more competent devs into the team to deal with the issues and implement any sort of anti cheat already with all those sales money.

Conclusion: at the end of the day, despite the game is a buggy mess, it still has a very good concept at its core. I can't recommend this game since i barely have any hope left for the dev, but i suppose if you dont really mind the issues, this game is fun. I wouldn't be surprised if one day there will be more of this sort of games in the future. Hopefully, this time around, these devs would actually give a poop about player feedbacks.",False

"Fantastic physics based party game around the structure of battle royale. With 60 beanboys racing/fighting/grabbing/diving/battling each other for the top spot as #1 bean. A blast with friends, your party maxes out at 4 though, and there missing some QoL features like nameplates for your grouped friends during scoreboard. Also I feel like not enough multiplayer games get this right but, also for the grouped friends if you are out or done the current event it will not automatically spectate them, small but frustrating.

Overall: 9/10
*Missing a few QoL features(tiny complaints)
*Very fun and reminiscent of Mario party/Gang-beasts
*The interface is simple and gorgeous
*Currently some disconnection issues due to it blowing up in popularity
*No local matches
*The music is catchy its almost subliminal
*Has team based games that are randomly chosen(this makes some people mad)

"A fantastically fun and creative take on the battle royale genre, fusing Mario Party with Japanese gameshows. Slightly sparse on content at launch, and servers are struggling with the seemingly unexpected player count, but with both those things confirmed to be getting worked on, it's hard to hold them against what is an absolute blast of a game.

..that being said, what's the deal with the microtransactions, Devolver? Don't you have a yearly livestream event where you make fun of other companies for being greedy? A $20 game with a f2p monetary system is, at best, deeply questionable. It seems as though you get currency from simply playing quite quickly, though, and wins themselves count as a sort of ""premium currency"" (that you *cannot* buy, for what it's worth), so it's not *awful*, just annoying and a blatant effort to squeeze more money out of a playerbase that already gave you $20. My prediction is that, within a year, as the playerbase inevitably declines (nothing against Fall Guys, but it *is* simply inevitable), the game will go properly F2P, so, if you're on the fence, it may be worth just, waiting it out till then.

Ultimately, I recommend Fall Guys greatly, but its business practices leave me miffed. I look forward to seeing what content gets added in the future, and expect to still be playing it for a while to come.",True
"Overall, this game is pretty fun. 

My only complaints so far is that there isn't a ton of variety in maps and the interface is not great/buggy. Obviously the map pool will improve as the game releases updates and whatnot an d the bugs (Such as not being able to back out of spectating without having to close the game/be invited in to a party by a friend) will be fixed eventually. 

With that said, I believe my complaints will be resolved soon so I do recommend this game. It's fun and silly and even more so with friends.",True

The physics are kinda wack but that makes it so much more better, you can try to screw people over by grabbing them but it is risky.

I'd say this is a very good buy, the only downside is there is only like 10 games in the rotation so far. I think there should have been much more variety from the getgo, but this will do for now until I burnout.",True

"Game is really fun, but the team modes are incredibly boring and feel extremely out of place and unnecessarily punishing considering you can lose a match that you've been doing well in solo, but lose the match because of bad teammates. Also, the team modes are unbalanced half the time, and if you're on the side with less players, you'll almost always lose.

The servers are currently unstable and the game will get stuck randomly after a match has ended or you die, resulting in a loss of XP for your character making the time you spent feel pointless, especially if it was a win.

Again, the game is really fun, but I can't recommend it as of 8/5/2020. The beta weirdly felt much more stable, and it's a shame that the problems the game has aren't that small. The problems are far too big to ignore. I can't recommend it yet.",False
"Unique take of a battle royale where it's just about having fun. 
Got a bit repetitive after an hour though, but it was still enjoyable. 
Lack of ingame user interaction (no chat or hotmic) means that it'll get a little boring without friends.

"I CANT WIN

"In this garbage game, you play as a bucket crab cleverly disguised as an adorable minion. The object of Fall Guys is to spectate as speed hackers rush through the course at impossible speeds, while the rest of you grab one another, preventing anyone from actually progressing in the course at all.

All of the minions are bald because they are forced to play this game every moment of their waking lives. It's a lot like being trapped in Vegas, but with no sex, booze, drugs, or money.

Bonus activities include:

* Buying expensive mobile-style dlc for a game which already costs 20 USD.

* Wondering why some people seem to always move faster than you, then learning the game already has a hacker problem and no anticheat.

* Spending half your time in menus.

* Swearing at your screen.

This is not a game. This is misery in digital form and it WILL eat your soul and spit out a withered husk that longs for the sweet release of a death which can never come. Stripped of will and soul, your ill-fated spirit will roam the candy-raver coated landscape of this game world until the end of days (approximately six months from now, when hopefully no one plays anymore).",False

I must say I dont like battle royales at all, the genre has been overdone and anything that remains is pretty bad tbh.
In fall guys it takes a unique spin on ""royale"" games as it's kind of like wipeout and its really fu!
What amazes me the ost is how you can play a game, eat sh*t and lose, and STILL have fun!

"If you've ever watched 'Wipeout' or similar shows of people competing in really dumb events where they fall, trip, push, or get knocked over through an obstacle course (usually).  This is that show as a game in BR format.  Run a series of five different events ranging from various obstacle courses, a matching game, a scuffed Rocket League, hungry hungry hippos, real fake doors, and numerous platforming encounters to achieve the ultimate prize, the crown at the end of this goofy game.

Matches are very short.  Each of the five rounds at the most might last three minutes each.  It's a extremely casual game with no real serious time commitment for each game.

No team matches as it is every jelly bean for itself.  You can, however, group with your friends and let the shenanigans ensue.  

Overall it is a fun take on the battle royale genre, and the devs plan on adding additional levels, among other things, to the already impressive list of existing ones https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1290605142493069312.

The team games are a little difficult, especially since you have to rely on beans you don't know to qualify for the next round.

"I was very surprised by this game. Unlike so many others, I didn't hear anything about this game until its release day. I saw a bunch of streamers going at it and thought this might be entertaining for my group as well and boy was I right! 

The game itself is a fast paced, mini-game filled explosion of fun. The graphics remind me a lot of Gang Beasts - very simple and colorful. The concept itself is straight forward: you begin with a group of 30~60 people who have to run through a series of events to see who is crowned the champion. The series range between 3 to 6 events, depending on the type of events and the number of people who end up qualifying at the end of each event. 

The events themselves seem to fall under these categories: race, team, tail, or survive.
Race: Make it from the starting point to the end without either getting eliminated by pink slime or not qualifying
Team: Work as a team to complete the objective. That might be: collect eggs, score points in soccer/rocket league knockoff, or push your ball down the course quicker
Tail: Arguably the most intense -- some people start with tails and some do not. Objective is to end with a tail (or if the team event, end with the most tails on your team)
Survive: These are the quickest way to ""thin the herd"". Events like these are instant-elim if you fail. This might be walking on the hexagon tower or running on connecting rotating platforms

I'm not sure how many maps there are in total, but I've played for a good few hours and haven't come across too many that I haven't seen at least a few times at this point. Overall though I feel like I already got my money's worth. I am enjoying the game solo or with a group and my viewers seem to be enjoying it as well.

If your not in front of the line you'll have to deal with the moshpit of people on side of the see saw making everyone fall off and sitting on the other side waiting for it to down. For the path finding level, everyone's pushing each other off and the people that win are the ones in the back waiting for the moshpit up front to find the path and push each other off. The team levels are absolutely BS. Which ever team has the most players even if its a 1 player difference they will win.

"This game is pretty much an early access game pretending to be a full game. Maps are pretty disappointing, only Slime Run is difficult. Most maps are so easy that it just comes down to the one or two RNG rounds. The game has some really bad maps that can really ruin the whole experience. Not to mention just overall lack of maps in general. For how simple their maps are they should have released with over 100, or had way more variety. Game is fun in doses, will probably be a fun game to play with friends once or twice. This game is not worth $20, but if you can get it for $5 it's worth it. Game just released yesterday and it's already desperately in need of more content. I would suggest waiting until they add some before dropping $20 on it.",False

Fantastic game idea and one I didn't mind spending extra on some dlc for. So much fun that I'm sure to jump in on between taking breaks from other games I play as well! A nice light-hearted game that will be fun to play solo or with friends.

"Just wanted to thank Mediatonic…

… For your awful and frustrating game, although OCASSIONALLY entertaining. 
Your developers are atrocious. Since launch day, the game has been riddled with inaccuracies and what not, one of these is a percentage of players who hack. What I find hilarious though, is that since launch day, the respective discord server for fall guys, has had a dedicated channel to reporting players who hack, implying they were aware of this situation from square one. However, and speaking from the present, it has been more than a MONTH since the game has launched – with no anti-cheat system. Did Mediatonic think they could pull out from this one? 

Along with that, a fair majority of mini-games played in Fall Guys are absolute bullsh*t. This majority consists of any tail-tag, team-drive or/and mass elimination rounds. 

Team, Solo or the Finale Tail-Tag is a game where you have to catch a tail from another person by grabbing said target, however, is extremely glitchy in ways to frustrate anyone. Due to Mediatonic’s awful servers, people with high and low ping alike, are able to grab said person’s tail from a literal meter, whilst other players can only achieve the tail whilst in a closer radius. Thus, tail-tag games have been disliked deeply by me and many others.

Team-driven games in Fall Guys are somewhat okay, but at times, is/are once again, bullsh*t. Sometimes the Gods who ascend above Mediatonic’s office, decide that I part with a team filled of skillful players, whilst at other occasions, I find myself stuck on the worst team imagined. The balance between choosing who is to play for who, is quite frankly, unbalanced. Upon playing, it’s visible that some teams will consist of good talent, and vice versa for others. Thus, just like tail-tag, me and many others dislike this form of gamemode.

This is also where mass-elimination rounds come in. They are like from the pits of the bottom of hell – team-driven and disposes half the server, hence the name. These rounds conceive most of the properties of Team-Driven rounds, which is why, I hate this dreadful game mode the most, and honestly the game itself. 

The only joy I retrieve from Fall Guys is when I get to be a dickhead, pushing others off, or winning a game, of course. But regardless of those practices, I still find the game irritating, which doesn’t help with the fact of the lousy developers.

Thanks a lot Mediatonic,
Gi_an",False

"If you think this game looks fun, it will be. If you think this game doesn't, it wont be. If you're the kind of gamer that looks for a reason not to enjoy something you'll find something wrong with it. If you like fun, you'll have it. This game is simple, silly fun for literally everyone. The fact that I could suggest this to my grandmother and we'd have a blast with it rules.",True
"This game is an incredibly fun take on a platforming/racing BR. You should go in hoping to have a good time not to rack up an impressive win streak. You aren't working with a limited pool of resources to put yourself on top, rather you wrangle around the map along with 59 other jellybeans hoping not to fall from yourself or from one another.

The launch day servers did have some downtime and disconnecting, but not for the first few hours. No problems started until a few hours later once there were too many players for the servers to handle. Much bigger titles experience severely worse server troubles in their first few days. Further, besides a couple connection problems on the server end the game has been almost entirely bug-free. 

While many players currently take issue with some of the maps/modes, we've already seen a few small changes since the beta to the current map pool, and have been told that further maps, modes, and features are to come in the future. If you can only spend a few bucks on games a month, wait until this game has just a bit more to offer, but it shouldn't have any problem getting to that point now that they've launched, especially so successfully. 

Fall Guys does feature micro-transactions, however it may be the most player friendly take I have ever seen. Everything is entirely cosmetic, the currency can be earned quickly by just playing the game, and the rarest rewards come from a separate currency you earn by winning. There are a few set cosmetics offered outside this system through DLC but again, entirely cosmetic.

Overall, Fall Guys is a refreshing take on the BR model that improves on many qualities other games have had issues with. If you enjoy Mario Party style minigames, platforming/racing games, or a casual challenge with friends, you will have a great time.",True

"The first fun battle royale since the tetris one. This game seems to be a once in a lifetime indie game. Not one with a cult following or critical success, (which it may have both of anyway) but rather a large playerbase. It's hard to estimate where the game will be in a year, or even a few months, but the fact that the game is $20 and still is struggling to keep its servers up shows a lot of promise. In terms of gameplay, it's fast, simple, and fun. You go from level to level, players slowly getting eliminated until one remains. The contents of the levels vary a lot. I would say the race maps are the best, just flying through these intense races to get place in the next round will certainly get you excited and very pissed. Other gamemodes definitely aren't as good, but the most of the team fights and survival type levels are still good. The game also has an item shop and battle pass, similar to Fortnite, but its easy to aquire fake video game points to pay for items in the shop and the battle pass is free, which is nice after paying $20.

If I had any complaints right now it's lack of QOL features, some levels showing up once in 20 games while others show up every game (thinking of Slime Climb and the Zombie one) but the foundation is super solid and I think with frequent updates (shouldn't be too difficult with what seems like a good amount of premade tools to create more complex levels) this game can have some genuine staying power.

Very fun game to play with friends or by yourself,True
"I love this game so much. As a lover of casual fun and competitive games, this is a blast. I just hope they don't feed into the competitive side too much. A ranking board or a ranked mode could really put some people down. It could make the game more aggressive than it should be. I love the straightforward nature that it is right now.

"This game has a good future but currently is a little underwhelming. They should've held out on release and gave us more games to play or more variants of maps so it's not the same game every time.

Update: I'm addicted to winning, I've started looking into local rehabs. I have a problem. Help.",True
"It is a fun game, but needs a lot more games. In one hour of gameplay i have already played four mini-games five times a piece. Needless to say this makes it incredibly repetitive. Imagine mario party with only ten mini-games. If they stick with it though, there is a lot of potential. I hope i get to see this game grow.",True

a nice game if you like to fall,True
"Yes. Dear god just buy it. Embrace it, throw your friends off the map. Only thing that matters is that crown at the end, Fall for the Fall Guys!",True
"Fall Guys is what happens when a Japanese gameshow is turned into a colorful battle royale.   60 players compete in multiple obstacle courses in order to be the last guy standing.   Some rounds have you racing through hazards to get to the goal, teaming up with other players, or simply trying to stay on a platform.

Even if you don't get 1st place, you can still earn in game money and season pass points just for playing.  You get more points the better you perform.   You can use the money to buy cute little costumes to put your Fall Guy in, give him a different skin color, emotes, all that good stuff.

My one complaint I have is that sometimes you'll play a team game that has you in uneven teams. (5v4 for example)  In the future I hope the developers push to have all team games start you with even teams.   Also I am aware there have been server issues over the first few hours, but I have had very few issues since playing later on in the night.   

For me, $30 CAN is a great price for this game, not to mention this game will offer free content in the future, such as more skins, levels, and modes.   If it looks fun to play, trust me, it's so much more fun to play it yourself!",True

"I've waited for two weeks since preordering this game to play it and I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed. What a fun game! Matches are short & sweet- and even when you lose hopping into another match takes only a matter of a minute or less.

it fun,True
"This game is utterly fantastic. It gives me the same energy I felt playing Mario Party with my best friends as a young lad, and you don't even need to play a board game. The minigames can repeat themselves on occasion -- true randomness can cause some undesirable behavior in matchmaking options -- but thankfully I've found literally every map tireless. Just won my first match, and I was squealing like an idiot over how tense it got. Incredible party game, well worth your 20.

P.S. The microtransactions are kinda crappy, but I've been getting really healthy payouts from performing decent and battlepass rewards, and you bet your ass I'm buying that pineapple costume.",True

Games are quick, and once you're finished with the game you're in you can be in a new one in seconds and get back to crashing through doors and stealing eggs and avoiding flying fruit again. After every game I found myself saying ""just one more"" and then ""okay just one more [i]good[/i] one"".

I think some of the games need a little tweaking (I've never seen more than 2 people get eliminated on Perfect Match) but overall it's a fun game that's definitely worth getting in on early while everyone is still finding their footing.",True

"Wellthis game is a 50/50 for me. Some gamemodes can be fun and is a silly game overall with nice and smooth gameplay but there are a few problems i encountered straight from the beggining.
1. I could not put keybinds anywhere on my mouse whitch makes it extremly difficult for me to play as i cannot use my pinkie and i still have to use the other hand to control the camra.
2.the grab feature get extremely annoying and it needs to be changed at least when it comes to grabbing players.
3.there are not enough maps/gamemode for a consistent and fun experience and thalf of the maps and gamemodes are straight up not fun in particular the team modes.
4. the costumes and costumizations are not an enough insentive personally for me to keep playing the game more.

overall i would not recommend the game in the curent state maybe if more content will come or if they fix some of the mechanics and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LET ME KEYBIND MY MOUSE

Fall Guys.... Wow.... What can I say.... This is the GREATEST BATTLE ROYALE game I have ever played! This is revolutionary! I can simply not fathom any other game providing the grand fun and content that this one does...

"the game is what you'd expect from it. a fun obstacle course with 60 people lol. 

It's for sure worth the 20 dollars..very well done and good looking game. It's definitely tons of fun.


Some things I'd note-- I'd say its worth the price..but i do hope they put out more obstacle courses in the near future. Because as of now the same maps over and over do get a bit repetitive. I would also like to point out while this seems like a great game to play with friends. I actually prefer not to play with friends, because then you have to sit through spectating. I also dont like that if you do get kicked out and you dont exit the lobby quick enough it makes you spectate the next round and you cant leave till the countdown is finished. It would be much nicer if it sat you on the end screen and let you choose whether to exit or to spectate someone. Otherwise great game, I'm excited for more to come.",True

Very fun & addicting but beware of rat people messing everything up and shitty servers,True
"This game is just a stupid amount of fun. It's having some issues on launch day simply because they didn't realize how many people in the world needed this stupid amount of fun right now. It's one of the first battle royale games I actually enjoy and I find myself saying ""just one more match"" which ends up being a true testament to how fun a game is.

The game doesn't take itself too seriously and even when you lose you find yourself laughing (unless you lose because of a team match then you're just angry)",True
"Overall, I would recommend it. However, the issues I have align with what other reviewers have pointed out.

The Good:
1. The silliness of it all, reflected in the art-style, music, costumes, etc. really set it apart from other ""Party/BR/Gauntlet"" type games.
2. A pretty good mixture of needing skill to maneuver and time jumps and so-on, while also having enough RNG to make it so that as of right now at least, the best player could always have terrible luck, leading players who might not handle things the best to have a chance to win.
3. A healthy set of minigames, I will say that in my short time playing so far with some friends of mine, we consistently had matches comprised of the same games, with 1 or two changing. If there are 25 or so games to play, and we consistently get 6, it gets a little boring, however they have stated that they will be adding more games to Fall Guys, so hopefully that amends this.

The Bad:

1. The team play minigames can really aggravate me, it is disheartening to feel like you are doing your best, but still can't succeed because other members in your group either don't understand how to play, or just messing around. Granted this isn't a real competitive game, it still sucks to be eliminated for something that is pretty much out of your control.

I think something that would be really helpful for the game overall, would be a practice mode for minigames, allowing players to try out the obstacle courses, or other team based minigames (Maybe with AI), to learn how to play minigames and maybe learn what to do.",True
"Don't take winning and losing too seriously. This game is first and foremost a party game.
While there are optimal routes on parts of non-team based rounds (Dizzy Height comes to mind), the existence of other players can and likely will mess up your plans.

The main fun isn't in winning, but in seeing & experiencing physics-based player characters trying to bum-rush a wacky obstacle course.

Team rounds actually ends up being the biggest RNG on whether you'll proceed to the next round or not, as you'll be assigned with random people whose competence and ability to teamwork is also random. Again, don't take losing too seriously, your opponents are also paired with random people.

My only critique so far (other than early server issues), is that as much as I like to say, ""Don't take 'not winning' too hard,"" the game gives you a crown currency to buy rare costumes & accessories that you can only obtain in two ways: 1) Rank up through the season, which while easy enough to do, doesn't actually give you much crown per season; 2) Win a whole game. This actually necessitate winning games if you want certain costumes, and I don't think that's a good mentality for this game.

I do wonder how the game will be once most of the playerbase gets used to most of the maps and maybe focuses on optimal strategies. I hope the devs can keep giving new contents at a good pace to keep things fresh.

Personally though, as someone who consider Takeshi's Castle and PS2 ragdoll physics as some of the highest peaks of comedy, obviously I love this game.",True
"Edit:

REMOVE TEAM MODES!! IT'S FKING TRASH!!!",False
"Fun game , greate to play with frends.",True
"The ""Free For All"" misnomer is misleading. Every few rounds, in fact, at least once a game for me for the entire duration I've played, you'll get tossed into a team mini-game and undoubtedly lose. 

I don't mind messing up and missing a platform, or being tugged back by some jerk so I barely miss the finish line, because that's MY fault, and it's funny. 

Losing a round because your team can't be bothered to defend the nest in Egg Scramble while you're trying to grab people and keep them from stealing while you're in the lead? Frustrating and annoying.

If it weren't for these awful Team rounds, I'd enjoy it. With the Team rounds, I have to give this a hard pass. Those are enough to make this game insufferable.",False
"Fantastically fun! It's pretty much wipeout the tv show, but game form!",True
"Only slightly recommend this game for a few reasons.
- Team gamemodes in a game which is 80% free for all just isn't fun when you lose and it is out of your control.
- Fun when things go right
- The matchmaker throwing me into games only to get an error message that it's already full isn't acceptable.
- I don't have an issue with the first day server hiccups
- Grab-chains are annoying and there should be a cooldown for you to grab a fall guy again
- Ragdoll kicks in inconsistently and isn't predictable half the time",True

I really don't think they anticipated how big this game would get on day one, which is really kind of hard to predict.

Do you want this game? YES. 
Is this game fun as hell? YES.
Is this game hard? No its a chill party game that can get you on the edge of your seat xD.

"1st day report..

IGNORE the moronic haters due to server issues and other little problems... It's day 1 for a small dev team and you need to look at the bigger picture..

I've played 3 games.. lost in 1st round, lost in 1st round and got through to the last round of 14 players..

It's superb. It's fun and when the devs get ontop of things.. This will be one of them that you spend a drunken night with many mates on TS or Dilcord... Or you'll play solo and just keep jumping on randomly and have an hour or two of fun..

Review might/probably will change... but seeing that the devs are having some small issues and the typical moronic ""I'VE PAID FOR A GAME FROM A SMALL DEV TEAM AND EXPECT IT TO BE PERFECT"" (buys every EA games game and bends over for their DLC's... You know... just a typical b1tch of a person.) but puts a downvote due to day 1 issues.....

However, they're very active on Twitter, keeping everyone updated with what's going on so far, and I hope they continue to do so. I had stupid amounts of fun in the betas, and will continue to have fun for a very very long time.

I see several reviews commenting on the microtransaction system. You earn ""Kudos"" after every match, and the battle pass is littered with bundles of 1000+ to spend on strictly cosmetic items. I played 3 matches and came out with around 2000 Kudos, which was almost enough to buy anything in the item shop. I don't see what everyone is complaining about.",True
i like these beans,True
"**** I have been in the beta over the past 3 months so do not look at my playtime for this review. 

This game has been one of the best games I have played in quite some time. I know today they are having server issues due to high demand to play but please give this game a chance. You will be rewarded. 
The fun, intensity, and hilarity this game provides harkens back to the days of the 90s and early 2000s when couch co-op with your friends was king. You will laugh, cry, scream, yell, curse, and be astonished by this game. 

All i have to say is BUY IT NOW, Thank me later!",True
"Its fun for some time with friends, but too be honest gets a little repetitive, DEFINITELY wait for a sale as the game is grossly overpriced for the content provided. Fun platforming but the levels are easy and get repetitve as you play the game. Most opponents in this game are donkey brains. 7/10",True
Hilariously funny and goofy party game to play with friends!,True
"Fall guys is a very fun game with lots of good maps and modes to play, this game is a hoot to play with friends",True
"Bought this on launch day to play on stream with friends and it was a chaotic blast of fun! I can't wait to play more once the server availability stabilizes but this game is absolutely worth its shockingly cheap pricetag, make sure you support these love creators!

I'm excited to see where things go when we can have fully private 60 person lobbies (a la Marbles on stream) so we can hang out with more than just 4 friends, but in the meantime, if y'all could learn how to not completely wreck the see-saws for everyone that would be much appreciated",True
"A horde of unwashed jelly beans shoving eachother off of platforms, and belly sliding through jam. It's pretty fun.",True
"Great game, and lots of fun cant wait to see all the new levels and features this game comes out with. Hope it has a long and happy future of content.

Yes it does have some bugs atm (server sided) but that is to be expected with game that is just released, also they are very much on the ball with handling those bugs and updating the community about it. That to me is a sign of a great Devs and a Dev team.",True
"When I was younger, Takeshi's Castle was my jam. The sweet soothing voice of Craig Charles graced my ears every so often, and whilst I didn't exactly know what was going on, I always found it a blast to watch poor Japanese people hurl themselves through a variety of obstacles in the hopes of joining fellow brave soldiers in storming the castle; commonly referred to as one of the most bullshit parts of the entire show. I don't remember watching an episode where a contestant won (apparently there were only 8 winners in 133 episodes).

As with many game shows, I sit on the couch watching along and smugly think to myself 'Yeah, I reckon I could smash this', as I struggle, 2 minutes later, to get up without passing out, and downing my 3rd Coke of the week. Alas, an opportunity to actually appear on a show like Takeshi's Castle is slim to none. This is where games like Fall Guys strive.

Fall Guys takes the Takeshi's Castle format (running through weird and wonderful challenges), send everyone out at the same time, and give it the colour scheme of a recent acid trip. You play as a rubbery Fall Guy, trying your best to be the winner of the show out of 60 other, equally-rubbery Fall Guys. After every round, a handful get eliminated until one Fall Guy is declared the winner, seemingly the one who is the least Fall Guy-like out of everyone else. And, to put it simply: it's fucking fun.

Jumping, diving, grabbing, hugging, pushing, falling, it's all great. The levels are well thought out, though could benefit from some of that hindsight polish. But the game is nicely designed, wonderfully cute, and certainly scratches the Takeshi's Castle itch. The game plays nicely on both keyboard and controller, so use whichever is preferred, and it seems to run nice enough on even the potatoiest of computers.

Unfortunately, the most frustrating mini-game is trying to get in a match itself. At the time of writing (4th August 2020), the servers are... well, trying their best. This is all to be expected, what with a small company behind it, and with a little bit of patience the servers will be okay in a few days (with a bit of luck). Other than a few other hiccups around playing in a party and server population peaking just before full and slowly decreasing afterwards, much like my self-esteem during my teenage years, the game does an amazing job and being fun, whilst motivating you to be top Fall Guy.

8/10 - Cheaper than a flight to Japan in the early-2000s, with the added bonus of not being shouted at by Hayato Tani.",True
Nothing but pure fun. Amazing game.,True
the fact that people are posting negative reviews because the servers are under maintenance is disgusting.,True
very fun,True
B-e-a-u-tiful,True
"Gaming's been in dire need of a proper obstacle course game for ages

This is everything I've ever wanted in one and more.

Soundtrack by itself is a 10/10

I'm going to lose my life to this game",True
"This game is honestly wonderful. I played during the beta, and had a lot of fun. It's great to have a battle royale style of game that's non-violent for a change, and also not based on the whole drop in+get weapons trope. Refreshing, and takes me back to my younger days in the 90s watching similarly wacky gameshows on TV. Highly recommended to those who are susceptible to getting tilted or salty, this game tends to just be really fun.

At launch, the game did struggle with day 1 server load issues, but that honestly speaks to the potential longevity of this game. The devs had conducted a lot of stress tests, but I genuinely believe they didn't expect the game to blow up (ha) like it did on day 1. Communication was good from the devs as they worked on the issues as quickly as they could. Can't stay mad, honestly.",True
"Really fun. Server issues on launch, but that is somewhat expected when your game reaches #1 on twitch the first day it's out.",True
how about we fix the issues with the servers and the connection issues before we release the game that is the whole point of beta,False
"imagine downvoting a game on launch day because of server problems lol
",True
Best Party game on steam! Tons of fun solo and even more fun with friends worth the price tag and more!,True
so good the servers died,True
It's like fortnite,True
"Just an amazing fun game.
If you lookin for an awesome party game or remember Takeshis Castle. Get this game it is all of it and playable with friends. Get 4 of em in and join 60 player lobbies and over the course of 5 levels Lots of players will get elimated until you are in for the race to the crown.
It is like a huge party battle royale, and super fun if you take it for what it is. 30% skill / 30% randomness and 40% pure fun IMO :P",True
"Initially, upon my first impressions, I gave this game a positive review. While I enjoy the races in this game, and have no issues with the connectivity issues at the moment as I realize that is part of such a populated launch, the team aspects of this game really dampen my experience. Thus far, every 2nd or 3rd round is a team game (Tails or Egg Scramble typically) and all of the team game experiences feel very frustrating and non-communicative. Thus, my success in getting into the next round heavily depends on one other team being targeted the entire time, or just the luck of getting on a good team. A game that sells its appeal on race-based mini-games like the obstacle courses seems to give me so many team games that I fatigue very quickly because the rush of making it through an obstacle is killed by an immediate frustrating and slow team game experience. 

I think a major improvement would be to make a playlist system wherein team games can be turned off, or kept on based on user preference. In addition, It is difficult for me to tell how many mini-games are available in this game, because the rotation is so repetitive at the moment. Increasing the rotation would be beneficial. That being said, I would rather play the same solo games over and over again than play any of the team games.",False
"As with any online game, launch day server problems are ruining the experience. But beyond that is an infectiously fun party game that I am already mildly addicted to, and despite being online is perfectly safe for my 5 year old son to join in with. Hoping the servers stabilise over the next day or two. 

Will be interesting to see where they go with it as the pool of maps/challenges could get dull over time. A steal at £16 though.",True
"Compré este juego, ahora soy una habichuela de colores disfrazada, adicta y sin vida 10/10

pain,True

First game I laughed at since the farts in Apes Oddesey.,True
This game is worth every bit of the $20 bucks. Fall Guys has caught the attention of everyone so of course the opening day is going to have server issues. Don't give up hope! Its launch day and people are acting like they've never experienced one before. Awesome to play with friends and you're guaranteed to get good laughs out of these cute Lil' Beans! Can't wait til the Devs get the server issue resolved and we start going for the Crown!! :D,True
"I'm surprised it took someone this long to combine the bones of the battle royale genre with gameplay that doesn't center hardcore gamer skill, but I'm glad that they did! It's just plain silly fun to play with your friends, and enough of it is luck-based that it doesn't feel like you're constantly up against professional esports gods when you're just trying to hang out and have fun.

I can see great long-term potential for this, but it'll rely on the game getting one of three things to solve the eventual issue of over-familiarity with the maps taking some of the chaos and even-footing away:
1. super regular content updates/rotations in the form of new maps, modes, & modifiers (this is my least favorite, as battle royale devs are already worked to the bone to meet update schedules and are rarely appropriately compensated). By modifiers, I mean things like a map that you've played before, but this time it's got half gravity, or meteors constantly falling from the sky, or the level itself is wobbly, etc.
2. some amount of procedural generation for maps, especially race maps. Keep things just unpredictable enough to keep matches fresh. Modifiers would also work here!
3. allow players to create levels! This one is hard but is my potential favorite. I'm imagining--alongside a level creation tool--a queue you can opt-in to to test out player levels and rate them, and levels that pass a certain rating threshold get added to the main queue's rotation. 

Anyway, the only reason I have all these suggestions is because I'm so excited by the core game! It rules! At the very least, it'll provide great fun with my friends for a little while, and that's good enough to deserve a positive review.",True
"By far the best party game of 2020 to date! Unfortunately it has some server problems, but its day 1, no way to anticipate the amount of popularity the game as accumulated over the two betas from streamers and other means. Overall this is an extremely fun game and having a group of friends to play with makes the game even more fun than playing alone. The game is 20 dollars, and I see myself getting more than my moneys worth just within the first season of the game, and that doesn't even include all the new things future seasons will bring to keep the game fresh! If you're looking to have a blast alone or with friends, this is definitely the game for you.",True
"Server overload on launchday, but when it works its an absolute blast to play. Be a little patient while they sort it out :)",True
"fall guys is a great game
posting positive review in support",True
Funniest game ever,True
Great game :),True
"I love the presentation of this game, from what I've played of it (yes the servers have been very messed up today, hopefully they run smoother later today/tomorrow!) I really do like the smoothness of the movement as it feels very Mario 64-esque in its simplicity and diving!

Also the soundtrack is legendary.",True
2020 GOTY! Pog,True
Very fun to play alone and with friends. My only wish is that they'll add custom servers and give the community the tools to easily make custom maps.,True
yep,True
hehe fall guy go aaaaa lol,True
Guys go Aghhh,True
"We need to stop normalizing this releases where servers shit the bed, or games are full of bugs, etcetc. If the game is not ready then don't release it.
When the game becomes playable again I'll change my review. Until then just don't buy it",False
"i was pressured into buying this game, no regrets",True
Pwum!,True
Really fun game to just kick back and have a good time. Can't wait till servers are back up after this crazy launch :),True
"Great game. Extremely fun and unique idea that puts a new spin on the Battle Royale/Elimination style of multiplayer that has been so clearly popular. Cool to see something other than an shooter have this type of format and find success.

Also, review bombing an indie game gone successful withing 12 hours of launch for having server issues day one is pretty unfair but also unsurprising.

I remember Call of Duty games back in the day having server issues on launch or when some new dlc would drop. Not to mention games like Diablo or some Rockstar titles having rocky moments with their online experience. What about the Master Chief Collection on xbox one? I think it's understandable that a game having 70k people log into it made by a relatively small team would have a few issues to iron out. Give them some time, this was completely inevitable. 

But hey that's just common sense and we should probably consider rewording that phrase nowadays.",True
FUcking Pog,True
"Great, fun game to play with your friends! Ignore the negative server reviews, its launch day!",True
This is the most fun I have had with a game in ages. I love those beans!! The servers are a bit unstable at the moment but I am sure they will sort it out soon!,True
"Never laughed so much at going from first to last in a game before. Somehow also manages to make playing in a team with randoms you can't communicate with an enjoying experience rather than a frustrating one!
Massive thumbs up, looking forward to getting obliterated by giant flying bananas hundreds of more times in the future",True
"Great Game, great Devs and Community Managers.
Servers are having some hickups currently but thats just due to the overwhelming player numbers.
Keep up the good work!",True
"Fun game


P.S. Review bombing is lame",True
One of the best funny games i ever played especially with friends but the team games could be better ... played this game 11H in the same release date.,True
The Fall Guys are so funny when they fall,True
lots of beans,True
Fantastic game!,True
"So there are some opening day jitters, but when I can play... it's amazing. The music is amazing too. Once things settle down it's going to be hard to walk away...

EDIT 1: 20 hours in, still loving it

EDIT 2: 2 solitary wins in 22 hours... but... I ain't mad, at least after I reach the reward screen. Tail Grabs are my nemesis.",True
This game is hella fun to play! Seriously great. 10/10,True
I literally sat here pressing spacebar for an hour and i had more fun than playing competitive CSGO! Worth the BEAN.,True
"If you want dumb fun buy the game. Yes there are server issues at launch and not a ton of content, big woop. $20 to turn your brain off and throw a little bean man into a blender of other bean men trying to fit through a door.",True
imagine being so impatient that you give a game a bad review because you're inconvenienced for a few hours.,True
"I played a little bit and had a blast, thats all i can say",True
Amazingly fun,True
Is good,True
thanks,True
"Game came out of beta too soon, obviously to cash in, which is totally understandable. But I'd expect the game to be at least 90% playable. There's a lot of potential though, but Devs need ASAP to fix the little things (for them but big for players) that would improve consumer experience, but for some reason they're taking too long to do something and by doing so, unfortunately they are setting an expiration date for the game. Most of team games are unbearable and should be fixed and also have separate lobbies, hitbox problems on tail games, the code behind a few team maps are also stupid, for lack of a better word, like matching unfair teams in football games(?), not to mention server issues every single day. In general I liked the game and the idea behind it, it's fun and amusing, has a lot of potential, the only ones that can screw this up, are the Devs.

Also, to say that they didn't expect the game to be a hit and use this reason for the issues that are happening is really weird. I mean, there was obviously a consumer research for the game to be created right? Anyway, game is fun and has potential, hopefully the Devs can make the corrections needed asap and it'll all be good to go.

7/10",True
ya,True
This game taught me how to love again.,True
"good game, bad reviews are just about the server problems. 
its a small company and they are already on it, 
it may be a little overwhelming for them right now but they will fix it.",True
Worth the money. Tons of fun.,True

Just need full in-house options!",True
"This is such a fun, crazy and entertaining game - so fun being able to be in a ""Game Show"". Come at this game for fun and expecting to lose and you are good to go :D

Ignore the complaints about the connections and servers. The game is a victim of its own success. Those who bother to pay attention - there have been a lot of updates from the developers as they are resolve the issues and they have been very active.",True

"This game is such a fresh breeze of air, such a fun and pleasant art style, fun game mechanics, and lots of cool customization. if you want a fun new party game to play to relax THIS IS THE GAME",True
"Purchased the collectors edition to support the developers.  Now the game is released and there is immediate DLC that costs additional money?  I feel jipped.  I know its just cosmetics but I expected this DLC to come down the line.  Why wasn't this included in the collectors edition?  

The servers need work as well, but its just day one so I have to give them a break.  Maybe they didn't realize how many people wanted to run into each other as cute little furries and grab each others tails.  Wait a minute...",True
i liek mini gaems,True
"Minor teething problems, which can be expected from most games. Its a very immersive game and a lot of fun to play. It gives laughs, happiness, sadness and a little pinch of salt just to throw into the mix. Get the collectors pack and you will get lost in it for hours.",True

very fun game to play with friends or alone much fun very good i recommend PogU,True
"This game is actually really fun, its nice to play with friends and its nice to see a new game that's not a traditional battle royal. All the bad reviews are just people salty because they are bad at the game or the servers are down, the game is so big the servers went down and they are actually talking to the community about the problems. 
Like i said if you read any bad reviews its about them being bad at the game or server issues which is vary common in new very big games, for example Warzone and fortnite.",True
yes.,True
It's da bes,True
"Despite the fact, servers are instable right now on release day.... its an fkng awesome game! 

I just recommend to play it with some friends on Voice and laugh your A** out loud while playing it.

cheers dev's! keep it up with new maps and i will love you even more! <3",True
This will be a great game once they fix the servers,True
"Fantastic game, real wholesome fun and left me giggling like a fool. :)",True
Amazing game to play and even when you lose you still have a great time. Once servers are fully optimised thios game will be faultless!,True
"I love this game and don't understand people who hate on it so much. As a software developer I know how hard it is to make the game from scratch and deploy it to perfection. Much bigger titles struggled on their release date and Mediatonic did a really great job making it. It's the proof that good games can be enjoyed without shooting, stabbing and killing around, and it gave me an amazing blast from the past to old school PlayStation games from 90's and competition games like Ninja Warriors, Wipeout and Takeshi's Castle. I love it and can't wait to play it with my bf <3",True
Vic Romano & Kenny Blankenship approved,True
"Game is fun, it just has some server issues on launch. It's fun to watch, controls are responsive and the variety of maps is good",True
"Very fun to play with friends, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience although I had encountered a few bugs and server instabilities. I can look past those considering that the massive amount of players (over 100,000) was not expected and I am sure that those bugs will be ironed out soon. Overall I'd give it a 8.5671 out of 11.578 with room for improvement after the bug fixes and additional variety in maps and skins. I definetly recomend anyone interested in playing a nice fun but also competetive game with their friends to pick it up it's definetly worth the price.",True

Amazing game, amazing devs!",True
"Finally a game with microtransactions that you actually don't need to buy, just play the game and you will build enough coins",True
"Fall Guys is sure to be the smash hit party game you all have been waiting for. Taking inspiration from Ninja Warrior and Takeshi's castle, Fall Guy has you running, jumping, and diving your way to the crown.

60 blob creatures enter a ""Show"" and each show consists of 5 rounds. As each round ends players are eliminated until ultimately 1 person remains. The rounds are randomized so you never know what game you may get. You could possibly have to run an obstacle course, or work as a team to get your ball into a goal. The randomization makes each show a blast and keeps the replay value high.

As if the colorful, vibrant, and fun levels weren't enough the music is also a delight to listen too. If the match loading screen took a bit to load I would often find myself bobbing my head to the catchy tunes.

The game also features a nice progression system. The better you do in the game, the more xp you earn to level up. Each level unlocks customization options and there is a store to spend points you earn each show.

Overall this game is sure to keep players engaged for a long time to come with the free DLC after launch and possible community tools down the road!

Except it doesn't make it any less fun!

Plus, the dev team has a wonderful Discord server full of suggestions/bug reporting/updates and tons more. 

It looks like the type of game that usually ends with the player saying, ""I played it twice and then uninstalled, but it was fun!"" except you'll play it twice.. 
And then you'll play it again... 
And again... 
And then you'll level up! 
And you'll play again.. 
Oh, I made it to the last stage!
Go again... 
And again...

Fun game.,True
"Love this game!
Lets get the reviews back to where they belong",True
"Good, chill, clean fun. 

The 'One Trumps All' game that keeps you playing and stands up to that classic assault course game show feel - without dry 20 minute periods of wandering through the wilderness waiting to find someone. 

Lovely level of polish, plays well, and comfortable to play solo or with friends.",True
the game really makes you *feel* like one of those contestants from Takeshi's Castle,True
Fun game!,True
"This game is great, good wholesome fun with a bit of randomness thrown in to keep things surprising. I can't wait to see what the devs have in store for us as the game continues to grow.",True
The only BR game I can lose constantly and still have fun.,True
Lobsided Jelly beans,True
i am compelled to write this because this game is so fun and seems brilliant and people will undoubtedly leave negative reviews because of the day 1 server problems and never amend them,True
"Very good game, please add a display resolution for 3440x1440.",True
best game ever,True
"Honestly, it's been like 20 mins and I've had two wins, this game is fun and addictive!
Well worth every second with a FREE, yes FREE battle pass with loads of cool cosmetics. Loads of new updates seem to be coming soon along with a hyperactive twitter/support team! A great community that I hope to see grow in the future. 
Any of the negative reviews are most likely salty kids sad that the servers went down for a bit on the release, this however is a good sign, shows they got more than expected!",True
Good Times!,True
"Sure, server problems on launch day are frustrating, because all you want to do is play the game.

But boy, is it cute,
boy, is it fun,
and boy is it worth the wait.

Whilst the gameplay may become repetitive for some, the skill level, clutch moments, tight races and fun mini-games will keep you coming back for more and more even after many hours of gameplay.

What could be improved:
More race maps
Larger variety of minigames

I just pray the developers don't abandon the game after it's successful launch and keep adding new content to keep us coming back even years after initial launch.

9/10, most fun I've had playing in a while!",True
Takeshi's Castle at home:,True
"This game is everything I ever wanted. It reminds me of the launch of Rocket League. So fun, so competitive, so satisfying. Buy it. You won't regret it!",True
This game makes me hate myself more than I ever thought possible and yet I can't stop playing. Help.,True
"This game is pure fun if you're looking to have a good time!

Servers are a bit overwhelmed at the beginning but hopefully that'll be fixed soon, as it is, in my opinion the biggest issue with the game.

Other than that, I could spend hours playing it!",True
Goofy lil game,True
Best hugging battle royale out there !,True
biggest esport of 2020,True
10/10 would fall again.,True
"ha fall guys go ""waaahh""",True
Very good game to play with friends,True
"Don't listen to all these whiny bitches who complain about team games or the lack of variety. This game is great fun, but do it in relative short bursts. Play for a half an hour or a hour at a time max.

First BR game I really enjoyed and did not feel frustrated when I die or when my team is garbage.
It's just a nice way to kill a hour here and there if you have nothing to do.

I will ensure you that you will have a blast and laugh your ass of the first time 60 jelly bean try to squaze through one door.

10/10 will fall again.",True
fun gane,True
"Really fun group game, easy to play! Really recommend this for anyone who wants fun time with a group of people. 

Lack of bigger groups or privet lobby’s is the only negative I have to say at the moment.",True
"Jellybeans in Takeshi's Castle with a bit of Wipeout thrown in.. What more do you want?!?!

Slightly bumpy start due to the sheer success of the game but that's never a bad thing! Game is super fun and replayable, active devs and great community management.. Keep up the great work guys, looking forward to seeing what you come up with!",True
"Great craic. And unlike other BR's, you wont be stuck watching your teammates play for 20-30m if you die in the beginning",True
It's super fun and stupidly funny. It's difficult enough to be challenging but not so hard as to be off putting. There have been some teething problems but the Dev team have been on top of everything. Looking forward to the addition of Cross platform play and any other new maps they will deliver.,True
"One of the most fun and competitive Battle Royale games out there, however I do wish that the party size is at least 8 players, 4 player groups are just not enough for a party game so I do hope that this changes later on. I also wish that when you get eliminated the game makes you spectate someone in your party right away since scrolling through all players every round may get a little tiring. Overall I highly recommend this game, gave me a decent amount of laughs and a great time.",True
best game I ever played,True
So far having a lot of fun with it!,True
"I'm an older gamer. I've never played a Battle Royale in my life - although I'm aware of the genre. I don't Twitch stream, although I am aware that this is a very popular game to stream and I have a full time job with other hobbies; I can't dedicate hours of my day to video games like I used to in college.

This is the perfect game for people like me. The skill ceiling is relatively low, you don't need to be able to headshot a dude from across the map, you can jump right in and play and probably win using some very well thought out strategy. It itches the competitive juices in all of us but the sessions are very short and digestable. It's the type of game you can play if you got some time before dinner is ready.",True
"It's enjoyable - but needs to have a lobby mode where you can play with only your friends instead of only having a single option to play with 60 other people. Missed opportunity.

There needs to be more variety with the games. Too often it's a simple obstacle course. Was expecting more mario party-like detail on a mass scale.

$10 game charging $20. Add game types and personal lobbies, then it can be $20. Right now it just feels incredibly easy and repetitive.",False
"Fantastic game, super fun, well worth the price.",True
"Great game to play with a group of friends. Utter chaos, almost always. Servers are having a tough time at the moment, but that's to be expected given how much press this game received just short of release. 

Only complaint: Team based events with uneven teams is not a good design choice.",True
"Putting aside the servers problem, this is a super fun game with infinite potential for the future",True
"I never posted any reviews on any games I bought.
So, this will be my first one!

I'll keep it simple.
It's fun, addicting and this game has made a huge comparison with Takeshi's Castle, which I haven't watched it yet!

It's understandable the server will be an issue during launch day. Positively speaking, that's a good start! Shows more people are having fun with this game!

A falling 10 out of 10 for me!",True
10/10 silly fun.,True
Wholesome fun BR that makes you laugh and mald. Amazing colors and really pretty art. Super fun with friends and randos a like! The Devs are amazing and have worked really hard for this game :),True
"It's a good and fun game to play, especially with friends.",True
[h1] 10/10 game would Fall again.,True
"The negative reviews take this game too seriously. This is a casual party game not CS:GO. You aren't going to win every game. It's okay to lose. Don't ask the devs to take out team games because you can't win every team game. Enjoy the game, don't try so hard. 

",True
"This game is an absolute blast to play, even more so if you are playing with friends.",True
Yes.,True
"Every aspect of this game is genius. Knockout style BR, free battle pass, and having to play and win games to earn currency used to purchase cosmetics. It's also very satisfying to get a win in this game. No idea why ppl are bashing this game because of its servers. It's only day one and it's hard for the game to handle over 100k ppl at the moment. Don't listen to those other negative reviews as that is the main reason for them. This game is worth every penny.",True
yes,True
great chill game. all the people whining about team games are just being little babies. get over it.,True
"Amazing game! Extremely enjoyable, great with friends or on your own. Costumes are adorable and the loading menus are quick! 5/5",True
"Already love this game and I've only played a few matches so far.

Day one server issues are bound to happen, but the experience even when there are server issues is clean and easy to start a new queue.

Give this game a try, you won't regret it!",True
Fall Guys is very good. The people are jellybean shaped. I wore a pineapple. 10/10 Would Takeshis Castle Battle Royale again.,True

"A hellish nightmare of bodies all racing to the finish.
10/10",True
"Game is a lot of fun.
Developers are an Indie company that weren't expecting the amount of people to flood the servers on launch day that did.  Tired of children review bombing a product and hurting the popularity of a game on day one.  They've already made great strides on fixing the servers.",True
"I'm a clumsy homosexual, I love guys *and* falling.",True
"The most fun ive had in awhile, nice to have something totally innocent to play. Best battle royale.",True
Needs way more minigames but all in all very good and fun game!,True

BEANS. And the music is a banger uwu,True
"Honestly these negative reviews are just ridiculous. Overall the game is fun, yes there are not a thousand game modes currently as it just came out but the grind is actually very fun and addicting. Not to mention, this game is super fun to play with friends on a game night with the boys (or girls). Don't pay mind to the negative nancy's who are so bad they can't get more than one round in and proceed to blame the devs and servers even though the game has been available to the public for less than 24hrs. Have fun mfs.",True
Great game :),True
Such a fun game! I'll never look at jelly beans the same way again.,True

Great game,True

"Content feels a little sparce but the core game right now still very strong and lots of fun. It can't be understanted how solid this game feels in terms of optimization, controls, and performance.

10/10 I met my dad playing this game,True
Very good combination of Takeshi's Castle and Battle Royale. Fun minigames and a great reward system,True
This game is the most fun I've had in a game for ages! It's so nice to be able to have some relaxed chill fun playing it with friends instead of all the super serious games out there!,True
"I played a bit of the beta, and have been spending some amount of time shortly after release.

The devs are doing their best to mitigate a lot of the issues that people are raising up, and I have full confidence that my investment will help them address many peoples concerns and suggestions. 

Concerning where the gameplay is now, all I can say is that this is the virtual obstacle course game show you always wanted to participate in. Even when I'm losing I'm in hysterics because of how hilarious and fun everything is! I also love that there is no way to chat or communicate with anyone in-game so none of that toxicity ruining the experience. Even when I'm getting grabbed, it doesn't even tilt me but just warrants an ""oh you!""

That's what this game is. An exasperated ""oh you!"" in interactive form.",True
Been dying to play this ever since the first beta. So much fun and replayablility. Plus the store has no effect on gameplay!,True
you are a jelly bean who's competing in wipeout what's not to love,True
Imagine review bombing something because the servers (which are now fine) were iffy for 30 minutes,True
"It's a really fun game and a fresh take on the BR concept. Don't let the (at the time of writing this) ""mixed"" opinion scare you off. There are people review-bombing this game with negative reviews because there were server issues at launch (this was due to the fact that they didn't expect 120k+ people to try and play the game and it overloaded their servers), and they're angry and salty about it and assuming the game and the dev team are terrible, instead of... just waiting. Come on, multiplayer games (especially highly-anticipated ones) will almost always have server issues on launch day. Be patient.",True
"Server issues left and right, but that is really the only complaint, and those issues can be fixed rather easily. Gameplay is fun and diverse. New levels will be added constantly in the future, and don't even get me started on the diverse and unique costumes!",True
"Great game, so fun and you both laugh, scream at the screen when you fall, played it for 1h now and it is hillarious, also fun with friends, can't wait to see what more fun things will be added next.",True
"Battle for your life as living candy, as you overcome obstacles and not fall into the devouring slime below.

Basically Takeshi Castle on Teletubies aesthetics :D",True
Great game! Can't wait to see how this progresses,True
"I Love this game sooo much 
But i hate these lags xD",True
"The game is great and fun to play but I see where some people have issues.  The game launch is a bit rocky, connection issues are common for now but hoping to see more improvements later down the line.  Remember that this game just launch.  A problem I can see later on in the games life is with the store and items requiring crowns (in-game currency for winning a game).  Items such as the Alyx costume parts costing 5 crowns for each piece, making it so you'll have to win 10 games for the full costume.  Another problem with the games seems to be the repetitiveness of the same mini-games.  While launching with 25, a few of them are team based games and final games, which brings down the number of full player games down.  Although they have stated that later on, we'll be receiving more games and more outfits.  Even with these problems in the game right now, I would still recommend that you try this game, especially with some friends, It's similar to a battle royale but without weapons and with jelly bean people.  Game is a blast to play and I suggest you pick it up.",True
fun casual game yes veri nice,True
This game is fun.,True
"This game is already super fun on day 1, so it can only get better as the team adds more content!",True
One of the funniest games I have ever played.,True
"The stages are super fun but the first stage is always some kind of race so you get to play those stages way more than any other stages. Even out the stages a bit or it will become dull to play see saw every time.

Also it's not team friendly since it's not fun to wait around and spectate all the time as soon as someone you're playing with gets eliminated.

Also it's pretty buggy and you get to spend lots of time waiting on errors and in general lots of time waiting and not playing.

I would like the game to become more rewarding, less waiting around, queue and be eliminated as a team. Then the game would be more fun,",False
"Despite the server issues on day one, this game is so fun. It reminds me of the good old Takeshi's Castle back in the day. The server issues will get fixed so be patient. Would recommend to everyone!",True
Played during the beta. Kinda like a mini game royale. Would recommend,True
"I'm the fall guy
                       ~Billie Eilish",True
"In short: I think that this game is a lot of fun. As of now, there are some bugs, and while they may be annoying, they don't take away from the overall experience for me. If you have a spare $20 and are looking for a fun light hearted game to play, I definitely recommend you give Fall Guys a try. 

Fall Guys is a battle royale style game where you play fun mini games. You start with 60 players, and each round, so many are eliminated. Each round is a different game, and you play until there is only one player left. The gameplay alone is a lot of fun, but the physics and customizations make the game hilarious and even more enjoyable. 

Going along with the whole battle royale theme, there are also seasons in Fall Guys. You earn fame by playing games, and the fame is how you level up throughout the season. This gives you a reason to keep playing and goals to work towards.

There are a few cons though. One is the in game purchases. $20 is not a bad price for the game, but I would rather not spend more money on in-game currency. This is not a big deal to me though. You can earn in-game currency by playing, but this does take a lot of time. Still, it gives you something to work towards, and in the first place, the in-game currency is only really good for cosmetic items.

A big issue I had was with the servers. It didn't take me too long to find a game, but whenever I tried to leave, I would lose connection. At first, I thought I wasn't even receiving my rewards after each round, but it seems like I was eventually given the credit. This wasn't a deal breaker for me, but it was definitely annoying. I still had a lot of fun playing.

Lastly, there is a very limited amount of games as of right now. This isn't a big issue for me because each round can go differently, and the mini games are a lot of fun. If you're looking to play casually, I don't think this is a problem at all, but I also think that after a lot of playtime, it could get old.",True
game of the year,True
Just like real life 100/10,True
"In these dark bleak times...One game will rise above and answer the call.

To rescue us all from the sea of boredom we drown in during quarantine.

This is that game and it is worth every penny.",True
"A game in the vein of Takeshi's Castle or Wipeout, Fall Guys is a ridiculously fun and chaotic game. 60 Jellybean people enter, 1 leaves with the crown. 

A variety of gametypes provide your battlegrounds as you run, push, grab and stumble your way to your goals in a hilarious fashion, and with promised future free content (The battlepass progression mechanic which splits it out into seasons, is also 100% free), this is guaranteed to be something to pick up when you need a quick blast.

Yeah there were some server issues on launch, but most people today realise this comes with the territory of being an online game from a small dev team that had a runaway hit on their hands, and honestly it's stable and any issues are minor and will be fixed in the coming hours

Also, I've played hundreds of matches during beta and live, and only once have I claimed that crown for myself, yet I still keep coming back!",True
rly good game <3 i love it,True
gang beasts meets mario party,True
Awesome game to play with friends/siblings.  You'll get bored after few minutes if you play solo.,True
"A lot of these reviews for a game called ""FALL Guys"" seem pressed that you fall over a lot.

At the end of the day, this is a party game. It's meant to be fun. This isn't a super sweat title, and if you go in with that mindset you're going to have a bad time.",True
"BR with minigames where you trip and fall again and again until you manage to get the first place.

11/10 Would fall again.

P.S. If you don't like the Day 1 servers issues please take a look at this indie game called GTA V that had server issues for far longer.",True
Love it!,True
MXC was one of the shows I grew up absolutely loving and laughing at. Which was the first thing that came to mind when Fall Guys got announced and I've been so excited waiting for it to release. Later realized that Takeshi's Castle is the original footage. I've been with the beta since the beginning and it was a blast! Server issues are common with any new release and especially with this kind of hype! Its a blast! it runs great and its a nice break from normal BR games.,True
"Launch day server issues aside, there's a lot of fun to be had here. Very unique game that I think is going to be around a long time.",True
"This game is a lot of fun. Love the bright and colorful art style. Music is reminiscent of old Sega Dreamcast-era games and/or Splatoon, and is very catchy. The game is basically Mario Party/WipeOut-like mini-games, in a battle royale, round-based format. Lots of hype around the game and seems to have such a large playerbase on day 1 that it even caused some server issues. I suspect once the issues are straightened out, it'll be something I go back to pretty often.

Update: After spending more time with it, I'm still enjoying it. Server issues are mostly gone, aside from the occasional ""game is already in progress"" error when trying to matchmake. Haven't been disconnected in the middle of an episode since the first day. Free battle passes every season is a really good move, and should be the model for all paid games. The skins in the pass are actually good and will encourage players to keep grinding it out.

My only real criticism is that it feels a little thin on maps, or perhaps the algorithm isn't mixing it up enough. I often play the same three or four maps in every episode, even though I know there are more in the game. The team modes could use some tweaking as well, as the outcome of those modes often feels a bit random. For modes where you need to push balls around, the collision feels very off or non-existent - not sure if this is an issue in the game or with the netcode. Overall though, it's a blast to play, and hopefully the devs will have a roadmap for new maps and content once they're done fixing some of the early bugs.",True
"Stupid silly fun. In the same league with games like Gang Beasts and Pummel Party. Graphics are simple but good, cosmetics are pretty cool. Currently game is having some server issues but relatively smooth performance and the absence of server lag at launch was pretty nice!",True
fun gameplay but needs more minigames,True
Awesome game to jam with friends. Definitely enjoying it and the money's worth. +1,True
Love it!!!,True
"I've played around 10 hours on the Technical Beta and just a few games in the full release. I've never enjoyed Battle Royales but the charm, fun, simplicity and low skill needed to play is perfect. I've been playing game for 23 years and I enjoy this game at the same level that my girlfriend whom only plays on her cellphone.",True
Fun Game,True
Hugs :),True
"What an absolute BOP of a game, goddamn this thing had me shakin' in my darn boots. Truly a masterpiece, only true gamers could understand it's glory. The feeling of being a bean in the hood is so new and fresh. This will change the game. Review bombers kinda lookin' like non heinz baked beans right now. NGL you're wasting you're precious bean life negatively reviewing this game. All my homies hate review bombers.",True
One of the best and most fun games I have played in a while. Play with your friends and enjoy one hell of a good time!,True
"Really fun, a little annoying if you get bumped everywhere but fun nontheless. I like how all customizations can be unlocked by playing (even though some are really hard to get) but are still purchaseable if you really want to.",True
Family friendly battle royale 10/10.,True
Very good game. Very fun I play game with friends at it was great. Lots of great minigames to play some of them are a little challenging but in a good way.,True
"look at the game 

now look at my picture

nuff said",True
Such a funny Game. Love it. Yeah perhaps there a not so much Minigames/Maps but the Developer said there will be more to come. This is made with so much love. Me and my Friends laughs so much. First Season Pass is free too. Good Job Guys.,True
Constantly smiling while playing this - perfect mix of fun and competition.. was itching to play so bad when the servers went down,True
"At a time where too many games are trying to take themselves seriously, Fall Guys is a breath of fun fresh air.

There are times where you may get screwed over by luck, or some silly physics, but honestly it just adds to the 'game show' feel of it.

Just like starring on Takeshi's castle. Super fun",True
It's good light hearted fun!,True
"This game is easily one of the best games I've played in recent months. Although the release day hasn't been the smoothest, the dev team have been incredibly transparent with it all. Please look past the server issues and try this game for yourself because it is a lot of fun :)",True
"Hey if you're reading this. Grab a friend and play the game. Or if you don't have friends, make one. There's 59 other jelly beans that I am sure will be wanting to give you a hug ;) 

For their own gain of cause xD

But seriously its a really fun game and you should give it a shot!",True
"I hate pigeons.

10/10",True
Great game for $20. The matches are incredibly short so there is no major time investment here. It's a nice game where you can kick back and turn your brain off and have a few laughs. It's the American Warrior/Hole in The Wall game we never had. It's a battle royale with no skill sets or rng weapon drops which is also nice. It should also be noted this game has a very lite pvp/combat system if you know what you're doing.,True
"Seeing this game get review bombed for server issues at launch is kinda sad if I'm being honest.
It's silly, fun and colourful and once the servers were up I was getting into games quickly and enjoying them.
10/10 would recommend being RKO'd by a hot dog man into slime again.",True
Played a lot during the beta - really fun game with alot of potential - look forward to seeing what they do,True
"This game is an immense amount of fun to have either by yourself or with a group of friends! Ignore 80% of the negative reviews, as those are just from morons who review bombed because they didn't expect such an overwhelming number of people playing on day one.

Get it! It's backed by caring developers who want to add continual content to a game they put their heart into. :)",True

Mastahpiece",True
"This game is very fun and it's sad to see that some people are leaving negative reviews just because they're experiencing issues on DAY ONE.

"Really fun mini-game elimination type game with a lot of potential. There have been some server issues with the games launch as it was much more popular than what the developers had anticipated (over 100,000 players simultaneously trying to login).

"I have played today almost 5 hours and few hours on beta. Game concept is really nice, I understand that the servers are overloaded at launch, but.. Where are the 25 new maps at the release? (or that was a misleading info).

PS: Add new maps faster please, or the game will begin to be boring in few days....

",True
"Imagine review-bombing a videogame because you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you can't handle waiting a couple of hours for the servers to stabilize on launch day.

P.S: The game is real fun, too.",True
Leaving a positive review for the virgin small pp that are trying to review bomb an awesome game. It was a blast in beta  and I wouldn't let Day 1 hiccups (which MANY games have) deter you from an amazing and fresh experience.,True
"Don't listen to all these people complaining. The game has barely been out 24 hours and i've been having great fun with it. There was an hour or so where there was some downtime as they upgraded the servers to deal with the huge unflux of people. That was about it. Occasionally the matchmaking goes there's server trouble. You just queue again. Sorted. Good, clean fun!",True
"All those leaving a negative review on release day due to servers, what is wrong with you? Are you really that dumb? Servers have stabilised now and the game is a truck load of fun. Hope all you negative reviewers refunded it and don't come back, you don't deserve to enjoy a game.",True
FatTofu Royal Fumble God says Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a very Pog game. Almost as Pog as me in Royal Fumble.,True
It's basically Takeshi's castle.,True
"Amazing take on the BR genre, lots of fun. 10/10",True
"This game is wholesome, whimsical, fun and surprisingly competitive.

Very fun solo and even better with friends. I would absolutely recommend this game.",True
"I'm not one to get super into BRs unless I have friends to play with, but this game caught my attention the moment I had seen the trailer for it. All good fun, and the matches aren't super long even if you make it to the finale so it's easy to get a lot done or just play a few before you have to go somewhere. Have yet to try it with friends, but I can only imagine the mayhem that would ensue.

Only gripe I really have is team games. Whenever you're on a winning streak it seems like it's up to the gods of luck if your team is competent or if one of the other teams just happens to have it out for your color for no particular reason. Super good idea in theory, but it sadly doesn't work out too well. Maybe make it so you only get team games if you queue with a party? Or make it an optional checkbox? Idk. I'm not a fan.

Oh there were also the server issues on day 1, but who is really gonna complain about that? The servers got overloaded because an overwhelming amount of people took interest in the game! Is that really a negative? Twitter says yes, but who trusts Twitter anymore?",True
Fun party game played alone or even better with friends. Comparable to games like Pummel Party.,True
"I've been failing around in the Technical Beta a bit with some friends and we were absolutely SOLD on the game.

From the simple yet cute character designs and 'voice lines' to the tense team battles, this is just insanely fun. We felt quite sad that on the launch day the servers couldn't handle all of the beans that were keen to play, but that doesn't take away form the amazing game that it is.

I even managed to win a game during the first few hours, sadly I got disconnected and was left without any FAME or CROWNS but hey they made sure to give out any items that weren't correctly rewarded.

So just please give them some time to resolve their issues with their servers and give them a chance, it's well worth it I swear :3

Overall a 9/10",True
The game is a ton of fun. Stop giving poor reviews for day one poor servers because you're an impatient twat.,True
This is the first game I've ever bought after seeing my Husband play with his friends and I really love and recommend it. 10/10,True
"The game is wonderful, funny, quirky and a nice step away from generic battle royale games. The game was released today, and because Mediatonic didn't expect the amount of hype, we - the people - broke the servers and they've been doing their hardest to fix it. If you see a negative review about ""connection issues and not being able to play"" I ask you, have you made an online game with super perfect servers before? If not, shut the hell up and wait. If so, DM their twitter and offer helpful advice.",True
Great game. Has been buggy but thats first day load - don't generally leave reviews but heard it was being review bombed. Games has been awesome when it works and looking forward to playing it when it's more stable.,True
"Played the beta and it was great, especially with friends. Bit of a rough launch, but that's to be expected considering how many people are trying to play. Apart from that, it's really good!",True
"Game is really good, just give time for the devs to fix the problems with the server",True
I have fallen and I can't get up.,True
game gud,True
"This game is fucking fantastic. The devs are a team of 30 people. Review bombing for day 1 server overload is silly.

All microtransactions are cosmetic only, the game is relatively inexpensive, and you can earn dope cosmetics without paying a dime. 

What's not to love?",True
"Every game has it's bumpy starts & this game is no different.
Regardless of this, this is one of the most enjoyable games I've played.  Beta testing was a lot of fun, especially with friends in a party.
So, I am sure once they have worked out the kinks in the servers you will find it a complete blast!",True
good game,True
Good Game,True
"This is definitely one of the most entertaining games I play in a long time. The reason for the bad reviews are simply impatient people who can't wait for the devs to upgrade the servers.
If you are a fan of Takehis's castle, you'll love this game! I would say the devs made a really great game.",True
"I recommend this game for people trying to simply have fun.

While I do enjoy this game, I feel like it's a great idea with slightly sub par execution. If they add in some more games, fix some elements of the team games, add private lobbies with minigame select, and accommodate larger group sizes, I feel I would enjoy this game more. I feel it def needs some quality of life changes",True
Developers of this game are geniouses. A very highly competitive multiplayer game which is highly addictive. If you love competition and winning things this is the game for you. Don't think twice just buy now you wont be dissapointed. 10/10,True
"good, but I hope the servers are fixed soon",True
This game has helped me cope with my inner sadness. I am happy boy now. Thank you Fall Guys,True
"Really fun experience, super addictive fun gameplay, would recommend for a night with friends, or even solo play, might get repetitive over time but for now i'm really enjoying over 16 hours played on beta and going strong on the launch day, server problems are to be expected on launch, shouldn't be a thing 2 or 3 days from now.",True
"devs communicate really well with the community via twitch, that alone is worth the $20 in my opinion. 

gameplay is really fun, especially if your main games are shooters or mmorpgs. fall guys gives a nice break from the usual games and allows for a bit of sperg behavior while having tons of fun. 

day one server issues are not new, even for large AAA companies. don't let the negative bombardment stray you. 

anyway, group up with friends and have fun.",True
Really fun game to play with friends,True
"Great game, such a clever idea executed really well!",True
"The game is great fun, it's like mario party meets wipeout and battle royale.

People are just so entitled to everything they want the day of release and give it a downvote. I've had no issues thus far, the game is just a bit repetitive but that's fine because the devs will add content regularly i'm sure especially when the game currently holds over 500,000 twitch viewers and over 70,000 concurrent steam players at the time of writing this.",True

"A desperately needed good time during a bleak time in the world.

Want a care-free experience that just allows you to have gut-busting laughter? Are you looking to play a game that simply allows you to have fun? Well, here it is. Thank you so much for releasing this game now when we need it the most. I've been having such a good time during the betas, can't wait to spend much more time with friends now that the game is finally released.",True
"Super fun little knockout game, with excellent sound design and cute characters. There are enough levels to keep each match feeling fresh, and with promises of more to come already from the developers, doubt this will get boring. Played about five hours of the beta before pre-ordering the full release.

The amount of people playing on day one has been hectic, so please take the negative reviews talking about bad matchmaking and servers with a pinch of salt - it's the first day, there's going to be issues.",True
Great game! awesome to play with friends or alone! :D,True
"Fun as hell. Had a huge grin across my face playing it, even if I was getting salty. Most of the negative reviews are slating the servers, whereas I had no issues connecting to them whatsoever across multiple matches. Only issue I did face was leaving lobbies occasionally taking 30+ seconds, but this is a day one issue and will hopefully be fixed asap. Regardless of some thinking $20 is too steep for the little content provided, I would say it's worth it as a full price tag. Looking forward to more customisation though.",True
"One of the few multiplayer games (and probably the only battle royale) I've played where it's still extremely fun to lose, which already makes it pretty easy to recommend! 

While Fall Guys only has 20 or 30 games at the moment, the developers seem really passionate about developing this game, and even the changes between the beta tests-- which were a week apart-- were pretty important. As long as they keep adding to/fixing/tweaking the game, I'm nearly positive Fall Guys is gonna have a long lifespan.

I'd consider the Fall Guys worth the money now, and it'll probably get even more worth it as time passes. Even if you don't decide to get it at launch, check back in a few months.",True
"much fun, 10/10 once server load stabilized, 
only a really smol brain would not recommend this game",True
"A fun battle royale-ish game with minigames.
Great party game to play with friends! 🥳",True
"This is an awesome little game.  It's super fun, adorable, and chaotic in the best way possible.  Also, please don't pay attention to the majority of negative reviews that all basically boil down to people being mad that they're having server issues on day 1 due to an insane amount of people logging on.  Other than those, I even agree with some of the points made in other negative reviews that have criticism of the actual game.  This game can definitely be improved upon, but I don't think it is in any way a bad game.",True
I have fallen and I can't get up.,True
"The game concept itself is amazing, but the execution isn't. I can understand the connectivity issues at day 1 due to the massive player count, but that is not my issue with this game. The biggest issue I have is the price point it's 20 euros for just 11 maps that most of them have the same mechanics. I am not saying that the game isn't fun it sure is, but I think that it would get repetitive quickly. Player progression is also pretty dull, the game went with a battle pass system that unlocks cosmetics and it doesn't help that a game with already a high price point has microtransactions even for cosmetics and cosmetics aren't really interesting for me. For now I don't think this game is worth it and I will possibly wait for sale or for new content before repurchasing. I think a steam workshop and UGC would really benefit this game and that community can make incredible content for this game, however until workshop/UGC is added I still have to stand by my points. (the review is positive because I do not agree with people making negative reviews just because of servers but otherwise I would make it negative)",True
"Really fun and cute game and looks to be very promising with the future of the game. Certain gamemodes need polishing and work but I can see that coming. The release has been flooded with people so their servers are a little busy and has been a little buggy but I can forgive that for a small game that wasn't expecting this much traffic. 
I am excited to see where this game goes and hopefully they stick to the cosmetic only micro transaction model",True
Absolutely Incredible Game! Now this is what a FUN Battle Royale should be! Kudos to the Devs working hard to make sure the game is up and running smoothly! Cannot wait for the future of this game!,True
"I can't wait to say, ""I played Fall Guys when..."" This game is going places, and this is my first time really getting in on the ground floor of what I expect will be a huge game. First day launch bugs? Sure... But you only need half a brain and a piece of gaming experience to see the potential and be REALLY excited about it.",True
"Fun & Amazing game! 
even if you play alone still Amazing

you should try it",True
"Super fun game, reminds me of Mario party with my friends back in the day, it has had a tough launch but when i do get in its extremely fun. The servers have been absolutely horrible, keep dc and when i dc i get no XP. i been battle pass 3 after 4 games with no xp won even while qualifying multiple times. still a 10/10 game, im sure the devs n the team behind them r gonna polish these rough edges.",True
I love this game already even though I haven't played a lot. Shame on you if you leave a negative review because of the servers being down. This game is amazing.,True
I've literally been playing with my friends for less than two hours now and honestly I'm having the time of my life. Basically non-stop laughter and happiness. These aren't just fall guys- they're funny boys.,True
Great game. Don't be put off by negative reviews left by entitled idiots who haven't even played the game but review bomb it because of server issues at launch which effect every game. they are truly the scum of the community.,True
Great game with a very cool premise! I look forward to the updates of new games and modes but it's already got enough bang for my buck. Their Social Media is also pretty hilarious.,True
"The only concern before I buy the game is player base since it calls for 60 players. 
Turns out i was wrong. At least not on the first day.
Hope to see the game and the community grow nice and well.
Ideal is great for a multiplayer game but lack of toxicity like quick chat and emo at the moment.",True
"stop hating on the server problems. its like youve never seen a blizzard expansion launch. the first day is always busy. stop down voting cause you cant play right away. it will get better, seriously people, grow up.",True
"Devs are having a hard time atm due to loads of players, don’t review negative yet please, this a very good game!",True
so much fun,True
"This game is just pure fun, chaotic goofy fun",True
"Really fun game. It's dumb and it doesn't shy away from that. You're not meant to be taking it too seriously just fire it up, play with friends and regardless of outcome just enjoy the time spent playing. Also has an amazing soundtrack.

Only cons would be that although they are obviously limited to amount of games you can play maybe make different skinned maps or something just to keep it a bit fresh throughout playing. 

A lot of the negative reviews you will read will have been written during the launch of the game where the servers were packed. However the team picked this up immediately and worked throughout the day to get the game running optimally again. Would highly recommend.",True
"Writting my first review of a game so you know this is serious! well i love this game so far even tho it has issues(i never had any issue so far funny enough) which is expected on first day if not first week. The game has all i want cute, funny, colourfull and even tho stuff are cosmetics it still lets me get them just by playing and i love that. I see great potential on this game keep on working on it devs never give up its a 10/10 for me and dont listen to those people whining and complaining they need to chill.

See ya on the slime! :D",True

"I find Fall Guys to be a really fun game either playing solo or with a group of friends.
I played quite a bit over the beta weekends and really enjoyed it and decided to pre-order.
Very excited that the game is now out.  Haven't been able to play much due to server issues, but on day one and the hype this game has, I'm not surprised.  
Can't wait to get some team games going later.",True

Currently being under fire from unjustified review bombing because of day 1 issues.

Fantastic game, Good job devs.",True

Funniest battle royale I ever played! Cant wait for more levels/maps.,True
This game is so much fun! It’s not super heavy or requires so much focus! It’s just silly fun and everybody can play! It only has a few buttons and easy to learn! Hopefully cross play comes soon! I loved the beta and didn’t think twice to buy the full game! I know the servers are acting up but the team on discord is updating everybody! Follow them there!,True

10/10 would fall again!",True
"This game is sick, Takeshi's Castle with your friends, grab them just as they try and jump over a gap and send them back to the beginning",True
"I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone. The people who are moaning it's keep going down and is to expensive - stop being bitches.

The game is new, it has had a big hype train. Most new released games will have server issues with a huge influx of players joining the game.

My ideas for the future:

- Add Crossplay
- Port to Xbox/Switch.
- New maps/levels/minigames < they have confirmed this.
- Private Matches so streamers/communities can go head to head.

If you are actually going to refund this game due to server issues on launch you are an absolute moron. Give the developers some slack!",True
"Fantastic game. Played in most of the test weekends. Its a game to play for 30 minutes (or hours) and put a smile on your face. A great game for these uncertain times.

Great game. It's being review bombed for no reason.,True

If you screech over ""RNG"" deciding whether you win or not this probably wont be the game for you. Look for something else to sweat over. Its goofy its going to be a mainstay in my group to play after losing to hackers in warzone for 3 consecutive times. 

It should only get better with time, with more maps on the way. 

It is a bummer that there is a premium cash shop and not just a in game cash shop. You already paid for the game and their is some DLC as well but to also have premium currency is a bit much.",True

I've been waiting for a game like this for awhile, a good way to wind down after work.

I played a lot of both betas and the game is crisp and smooth when the servers aren't overloaded.

Launch is off to a rocky start due to server issues but they have been hard at work and the game should run just as well or better then the betas by Friday after launch. 8/7/20

Ignore the people who are leaving negative reviews, they clearly have never been part of any day 1 multiplayer only game releases and their reviews show that they lack that knowledge. 

Especially the ones complaining about the $20 price tag, which is a completely fair price for what you are getting up front at the core. The devs have already stated they plan to add new maps, minigames and cosmetics when they continue to add post launch content.",True

Servers are burning right now, they were fine in the beta so I'm sure they will sort that out

"Fall Guys is a super fun, BR styled game that takes inspiration from the likes of Takeshi's castle and Total Wipeout. A must have for fans of these shows!

I've played a ton of the Beta tests and I've enjoyed every bit of it, and the full game is no different! It's genuinely one of the most fun games I've played in a while.

The soundtrack is amazing too, has a lot of Splatoon vibes going for it! The gameplay is awesome, I love the way that the Fall Guys control and there are also some good movement options with the dive which can hlep you out in a pinch! 

I definitely recommend this game a ton, and it's even better with a group of friends!

Assemble your friends, and let's fall, guys!

"game is very good fun with friends.my only gripes with the game at the moment is server rubberbanding currently mainly because of a game mechanic of grabbing other players because at the moment there's a high chance for you to get vacuum  grabbed back to a player who's a far away from you! this is a problem in the game because most of the time it will lead to you dying early on and worst ruin your chances at winning in minigames that require you to be grabbing another player or getting grabbed yourself eg the tail grabbing minigame is a crapshoot of having to stay ridiculously  ahead of other players to not get grabbed by nothing and lose the tail or have the tail holder mess up so bad your able to grab him and the game actually registers it for once.

In my opinion you need to have a nice party to have a lot of fun in the game, currently parties can have only up to 4 players which hopefully changes in the future :) I think you can have a lot of fun playing together but it has also the downside that basically everyone who drops out early need to wait for the remaining party to play the next maps.

Definitely the game needs more maps and maybe some kind of blacklisting because there are a few which are not great in my opinion. But the developers are working on it!",True

However, they need to make way more mini-games, especially for the final round. I think it would be great if instead of having about 12 people at the end competing for the win, it widles it down to mauch smaller and unique mini-games of 2-6 people. There is a lot of improvement to be had in this game, doing the same mini-games over and over is already becoming repetitive, However I can see this turning into a masterpiece if the devs keep adding content and listen to its players for new ideas.",True

"Pros
- Enjoyable minigames, even after playing them multiple times, doesn't feel boring (minigames definitely reminiscent of Roblox, Minecraft, Garry's Mod)
- Lots of customization. Lots of variety in the customization
- The battle pass type system is free
- The physics are silly in a good way

Cons
- Grabbing doesn't work very well, especially not when you're going up something
- Very buggy as of (8/4/20) Mouse will appear on screen during some rounds and you'll have to hit ESC which wastes time during a match and could make you lose. Hitting ESC after losing and then again at the end screen makes the game lock up and you have to fully restart it. 
- The menus and game selection are very slow
- Monetization, you can buy DLC outfits, which would be fine to support the devs. However, the ""DLC"" icon seems a bit large for them to not add any more outfits, which is worrying. What's worse however, is on top of that, they allow you to buy coins, rather than making the amount you get larger so you never feel a need to buy them. (Some people say ""this is a nitpick"" but I consider collecting outfits to be fun in games like this, and putting them behind a paywall over and over again, or making it feel like you're not getting much to the point where someone would rather pay, sucks)

Pros:
Takeshi Castle Style! If you know the television series, you know what's coming.

Cons:
- few maps
- long wait between the games, should be faster.

Neutral:
- game price = ingame shop - you can earn game currancy, but at a slow pace - or buy with real money. 
- yeah, many luck based rounds - if this isn't your style, you might dont like it. For me it's part of the game principle.

I have not stopped playing, finding a game takes up to a maximum of 90 seconds (for me) and the stages are fun and creative. There is also micro-transactions that can be made (what do you expect from a battle royal game c'mon) but earning coins is just as easy by playing games that quickly add up over time.

super pog,True
"Great Game, but bad Developer.
The reason?

[code]From this point i will refer Mediatonic (The Developers) as [u] They [/u] (underlined)[/code]

[olist]
    [*]We still can't use our Steam Name in game. I know it's because people are injecting HTML codes and Bad Words in their steam names. But I'm pretty sure [u]They[/u] can just have a list of Curse words and HTML codes and filter them in the game.

    [*]There are so many cheaters and the devs don't want us to report them.
Why? [u]They[/u] said it's because it's useless to report them (the cheaters) since they only have 4 Digit numbers in their name and those 4 digits are shared by 1000+ other players.
Can't [u]They[/u] just increase the digits for more unique identifiers? or have like alphanumeric characters as player names for unique identifier? OR just create a report system so we can report the cheaters easily and [u]They[/u] can also manage reports easier.

    [*][u]They[/u] say cheaters are automatically banned after a match ends, and [u]They've[/u] caught so many cheaters the first time they cheated using this ""Anti-Cheat System"".
But i've seen cheaters using Legendary Skins that costs multiple crowns to buy. I'm sure people don't just cheat after they buy Legendary Skins, it seems like they've won matches using cheat and not getting banned, and this ""Anti-Cheat System"" doesn't work really well.
Just because [u]They[/u] caught a lot of first time cheaters, doesn't mean there are no long term cheaters not getting banned.
Not my screenshot, but here is the proof of long term cheaters not getting banned. https://i.imgur.com/MYSEQ2d.jpg

    [*]There are some costumes that gives advantages (Pineapple costume) during team games, they are not colored based on their team color, instead the costumes are white colored, making it hard to determine which team they are on. I can't believe [u]They[/u] didn't fix this in the same week when the problem was found. Instead, they sell another bugged costume (Monkey costume) recently.

    [*][u]They[/u] don't want us to share videos or clips of cheaters because it will hurt [u]Their[/u] sales. [u]They[/u] are clearly not giving us transparency about their current ""Anti-Cheat System"", I really hope [u]They'll[/u] just stop lying and tell us the truth. We can understand the situation. Just stop lying.
[/olist]

TL;DR The Developer doesn't fix things but [u]they[/u] don't want to take the blame.

I know Mediatonic is an indie dev with only 230 employees, but surely they can do better than this. Give some transparency and not lies. And maybe even hire some programmer?",False

"[h1]THE BEST MULTIPLAYER GAME OF 2020[/h1]
Fall Guys is a fun, 60 player battle royale which are inspired by Takeshi's Castle and Wipeout TV Shows. 
Basically, you play as these cute, wiggly jiggly, jelly beans through many different obstacle courses to become the last one standing. It's a simple format like the TV shows i mentioned above

[h1]NOT AFRAID TO BE DIFFERENT[/h1]
These days, people are way too horny towards the same old generic shooters or some cashgrab battle royale, this game is made to be different which stands above the rest of the games you typically see in the market. I like how the devs took a risk making this game and look how popular this game turned out on launch day to the point where the servers crashed non stop. The social media on twitter also helped the game too ;)

[h1]PROS[/h1]
+Different from any battle royale, ACTUALLY FUN, you don't need gunfire to make a game fun
+Simple, yet fun and unique character designs
+Fun, casual game, easy to learn, hard to master.
+CROSSOVER SKINS, Half Life skins, imagine them adding Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 skins or anything, the possibilities are ENDLESS
+Has many variety of modes, including both solo and team modes
+CRAZY PHYSICS
+Catchy, fun soundtrack
+Fair monetization, earning ingame currency is super easy, some skins only requires to win matches in order buy like Half Life: Alyx skin (I hope in the future we have the option to either win matches or buy directly using real money as DLC at Steam store or ingame), if this game is free to play i'm betting getting currency will be super hard
+Simple controls, short matches 


[h1]CONS[/h1]
-Server problems (Well yeah, they didn't expect to get these many players)
-Some skins should be purchasable with IRL money even though in game the only choice is to win matches (giving options to the player is always welcome at the same time you can earn money to improve development)

[h1]THINGS THAT CAN BE IMPROVED IN THE FUTURE[/h1]
-Custom lobbies 
-Custom map editor tools, steam workshop support would make this game last forever 
-More crossover skins please 
-Decrease overtime period during team modes or let the tied team battle it out or something 
-Hide cursor when using mouse, it's kinda annoying 

[h1]Tips on how to git gud[/h1]
-If you play a lot of platforming games in your life, congratulations you will be a natural in this game 
-Utilize diving, sometimes it can save your life
-Help your team during team modes, cover their asses properly 
-Use common sense (Yes i know sounds crazy)

[h1]FINAL VERDICT[/h1]
Overall, i think this is one of the best games to come out this year. The first time i saw this game at Devolverland E3 Digital Expo Demo i was like what the heck is this game so cute and the way these beans dance are so weird but turns out it has become of the funnest games i ever played this year. This game is just pure fun, no need to tryhard in ranked or something, i think this is what the gaming industry needs. A fun game, a fun multiplayer game.
With updates and constant support from the devs, i think this game will stay around for awhile due to its elimination nature which will make people come back for more!

9/10, go buy it the devs deserved it.",True

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOWoo7cjSz8&feature=youtu.be

The music is quirky the chracters are goofy and the physics and mini games are absolutely fun with 20+ of em and more to come. You grab, jump and dive that's all you need to know Think cartoony and goofy American Ninja warriors but with 60 players and as jelly beans so you'll have to adhere to the physics, finally battle royale game without guns.

There are many  unlocks and unique costumes to earn and if you win first place you earn crowns to unlock special cool looking stuff. Seasons in this game will keep you going and so far there is only 25 maps so hopefully we'll see more.
At the end of the day all I got to say is, only one person will be left standing.

This is probably the best  party game since sliced bread. My only downside on this game is when there isn't 60 players to play, and how fast will they release maps and modes for the players, The team game needs a fix up some sort of communication so whacky and random and like many, i absolutely hate them.

THEIR SERVERS SUCK... I REPEAT... THEIR SERVERS SUCK...

How to enjoy this game...
1. Open Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout
2. Start Matchmaking
3. Stare at the falling guy for like an hour
4. Get into game
5. Get disconnected in-between the round
6. Repeat step 2, 3 and 4
7. Get eliminated in tail tag cuz holding a, guy with a tail, is not going to help you and others will grab your tail from 10 feet away.
8. Hop into their discord server with a hope and complain about their servers (Probably 100th time)
9. Tell them your problem and they will give you a copy-pasted message just like a bot.
10. Tell them that you are going to write a negative review and get your message deleted.
11. Wait for their warning and then ask what you did wrong
12. Get muted for 10 hours for being disrespectful (according to them)
13. Repeat steps 1 to 12 everyday
14. Write a POSITIVE review about this game...
15. UNINSTALL

They can't stop me here. They don't give a shit now. After making so much money they can't even upgrade their servers. Such a shame.
It's been months but still same issues occur everyday. They got our money and now they don't give a fuck... Their servers sucks.. in every corner of the world (world is a globe)...

"This game is really good and i really really enjoy playing it (sank 100+ hours in less than 2 weeks). But it has some major issues and i could only tolerate it for so long.
By the time i made this review, hackers are not an issue anymore, as they already implemented new anti cheat.

But network issues is A HUGE problem for this game, i dont know how it is in other server, but i live in SEA region, and i got disconnected sooo often. One time, i got disconnected 3 match in a row, back to back, and if you think that it might be my own internet, i highly doubt it since i've checked my internet speed and stability (i even went to someone's stream on twitch and play it at 160p just to see if my internet is spiking or something). It is so frustrating that i have to stop playing the game for now.

So yeah, downvote from me for now. Would change the review once they fixed it somehow. Sorry to the dev.",False
"You have no chance to win if there is a hacker in your game which is literally almost every single game you go into. Its super buggy with its movement and grabbing system, I once grabbed a guy with a tail for over 3 sec and never got the tail. The collisions are super buggy and makes the game incredibly frustrating. The game is almost all luck, I have gotten to the final stage of the game almost 100 times and have only one once due to either hackers and or being incredibly unlucky such as Fall Mountain balls clogging up a path way making it impossible to win, getting grabbed from someone from an unreasonable amount of distance away from you, or some how getting flown in the air from the collision of another person out of no where. It wouldn't be a huge problem if it was every now and again, but it is literally every single game. The majority of people who have crowns are from hacking. This game has an amazing cartoon style and the cosmetics are amazing, but it is incredibly frustrating and not fun most of the time. The coolest cosmetics are bought from crowns which you can only obtain from wining or the battle pass but you only get three from it which is not enough to buy one of the costumes which cost 5 for each lower and upper piece which isn't bad because it adds very good value and satisfaction of getting them, but since getting crowns is almost impossible its very saddening and grinding to get a win is very frustrating and makes you not want to play the game. The mini games are also soooo repetitive and super boring after playing them countlessly, hopefully they will add a lot more maps in the new season. Personally, if you don't want to break your controller or mouse and keyboard, don't buy this game until some of these problems get fixed.",False

"Jumping puzzle style battle royal. 

So if you like jumping puzzles and you like battle royal, this is the game for you. 

You will compete against up to 60 players for the crown. You collect points and crowns to buy unique skins. Its fun for all. 

You can currently, 8/7/20, play with up to 4 of your friends in a party. My hope is this will be increased to AT LEAST 10. That is mainly because our normal game night with friends is 8-10 people. 

Even if you get eliminated while play with friends, its fun to cheer those who made it on. 

You need about 15-20 minutes total to compete for the crown.

"The Good:
- It's really funny and enjoyable to play
- The music and art is fantastic
- Unlocking cosmetic items is really satisfying

The Bad:
- Severely lacking content for the price (After an hour or so, you will have seen all the game has to offer)
- The games use of paid DLC cosmetics is a bit concerning as the games progression is built on unlocking cosmetics

Overall:
While it is a great game, it just feels a bit too empty in terms of content. Until there is more content added, I can't justify the $20 price point. With the game's lack of content and a hint that they may paywall future cosmetic items, this game—in  its current state—just feels a bit like a free-to-play game that you need to pay for. However, if $20 is not much to you, then I do recommend the game. There is much fun and positive energy to be had in this game!",False

"for those who don't already know this is essentially minigame battle royale
most minigames are physics based and highly entertaining, although some (cough cough team games) can be very frustrating
some game modes can appear almost consistently and it can be a little repetitive

graphics and sound are vibrant and joyful, and the whole game bursts with charm
large range of cosmetic items and customisation is unlockable without *having* to pay extra money (but you do have to grind a little for some of the more expensive items)

there have already been a few annoying bugs which have been addressed quickly - 10/10 for quick fixes
hackers also exist but who cares it's a casual game

lack of cross platform support is very annoying for some but will soon be added (hopefully) as well as split screen play
controller support is now working *but* you may need to configure custom binds in steam (as it doesn't seem to work ingame yet)
tech nerds like me will probably be annoyed by the lack of fps cap (i tried selecting 1920x1080 60hz and it continued to render at my display refresh rate, 240). this may be fixed in future but i have not seen anyone else mention this bug

overall an excellent game to pick up and play for short periods, will be greatly improved by more content and gamemodes in the future",True
"This is Takeshi's Castle in a really bright and cartoony world that allows the otherwise brutal violence to be entirely acceptable and funny to all involved.

This game would not work if people could type messages or voice chat. The anonymity of the entire thing is both it's saving grace and the sole reason it remains so funny, random and utterly brilliant for a party style BR game in the theme of a Japanese game show. That like many great game shows that come out of Japan Fall Guys prioritises the harm of the contestants over any credible player ability or skill and it is absolutely better for it.

You'll go from cursing laughing at people for being stupid and falling for a trap, cursing out all of humanity and then to yelling obscenities at a character model for getting in the way. Then giggling at the sheer absurdity of it all within the same minute of game play. It manages to be incredibly fun to play, while still managing to be incredibly competitive. Be it solo or with up to 4 friends on voice comms. You'll love the sheer hilarity and equally detest all of mankind for being bad team mates in the few team centric maps in the game.

It had it's launch issues for sure and people will probably have written bad reviews based on that. It's better now, but it will still probably have a few issues here and there as most games do. But this a game you need to play and enjoy while there are a lot of people playing. Because if for some reason it dies off at some point, it will remain a ""you had to have been there"" game with so many stories that people will probably remember for a good while after.

GAME SUCKS.,False
"This game is very promising, but there are a LOT of balancing issues left in the game that could be easily avoided.

I would recommend that game but I can't honestly do it with those issues left in the game.

Issues I found :

1 - Team games are a 1/[number of teams] gamble leaving you with a chance of being arbitrarily eliminated based on factors that don't depend on how well you played.
2 - some game modes rely a lot on luck, mostly in the last rounds
3 - some cosmetics can NOT be obtained by most of players without cheating because the currency to get them is not obtainable if you don't win.

My advices to make it better :

1 - replace team games entirely with new modes OR make the match making more fair for every player to have an equal chance of winning
2 - redeuce the luck factor of all game modes
3 - make the crown currency obtainable more easily by just playing past a certain number of rounds (and probably raise the prices of the legendary cosmetics with it)

"I wish there was a middle ground to review this. It has potential to be a multiplayer game that will last a long time, but it has some pretty huge flaws...

Pros: 
-Lot of the ideas behind it are pretty fun, all the group chaos really adds to how exciting it is. 
-It is simple enough where anyone can jump in and make it to the final round. 
-It also is fast enough to where you can play quite a few games in an hour.

Cons: 
-The final round feels pretty bad. There are only 4 games. The race is always won by the person who has a perfect run. If you got bumped or stumbled once, game over...
-If someone trolls you it is game over, and that is way too easy to do.
-Team games all feel pretty bad, when I lose I rarely feel like it was my fault. Some people just don't understand the game either, lost a tag game cause the starting tagger ran instead of tagged...
-I'm starting to notice groups of people working together to win, one goes for the victory, while the rest of them grab you to stop you. Needs to be a separate que for groups.
-Cheaters... Mediatonic claims they know when they cheat, but they still get the crown and non cheaters get screwed... Lost the final race 3 times in a  row to someone who made it in 10 seconds... I hate you fall guy 1600, soooooo much.....
-Games might be too easy, its why the winner is always in the front line and they never made a mistake and RNG favored them.

Suggestions:
-Start a que 2 weeks in the season for winners with more than 10 wins, and another que halfway in for people with more than 30. This will give the worst of us a chance to win at least once.
-Get a second and third place. Give first 3 crowns, second 2 crowns, and third 1 crown.
-Remove team games, they are all pretty bad.
-Only solo game that is bad is the seesaw race. Need to limit tipping or have it tip back and forth automatically.

TLDR: Good game, just needs a bit of developer love to become an amazing, must buy game.",False
The entire game except for the last two rounds is mostly luck. At the beginning you might start infront of other players. if that happens you will survive the round. If you start at the back you will have much less of a chance. Its a good concept and the art is great but many times you will be screwed from the beginning.,False

By design, the game is 50% skill and 50% chaos, so embracing the chaos is the mentality I recommend while playing. Currently there are heavy server issues going on, but expect to see more positive reviews after servers become more stable over time.

Even so, this game has worked for me since last night and even the PS4 version is fine atm from what I played. It's debatable whether the game is worth it for $20, but there is a decent amount to do at the moment and more updates will be released down the line. Regardless, this game is loads of fun whether you're on your own or with a group of friends. No matter, the game is really enjoyable. I really hope cross play becomes a thing and other stuff to help the game be that community game, but for what I paid, I really enjoyed the mini games in the game atm and am looking forward to what is released in the future.

"Game is fun alright, big mario party vibes with a bit more physics shenanigans. 
I won't get into the multiple server issues at launch, as a guy who played mmos on release in the 2000s, i grew immune to that.

My main gripe with the game is that it gets very repetitive very fast. For a ""mini-game collection"" it actually boasts very few of those. Adding to that quite a lot of them have the same ""vibe"", few break the monotony and  I ended up ""oh no, not this one !"" way to often, way to fast.

Good point is that the bugs are rare, the gameplay itself is quite precise an polished. 
More games and more variety in shape and form would go a long way toward keeping the buzz alive. But let's face it, it would need to happen fast and i am not sure they have it in the pipes.",False
It's literally all about how good of wifi connection you have. It's not about how much skill or luck. Only how good of a lag you have to get knocked out of tail grab when your 5 feet away from another person. Or getting knocked out of seesaw from tripping over nothing.

There is a lot of RNG but that’s the best part...
Mechanics are fun but your little stubby legs will make you fall over more often than you think.
But my biggest salt is with cheaters... game is full with cheaters, every match i played cheater got to be the last man standing (either by sliding 1cm from the ground or just glitching animation in the sky or whatever)

It's not bad. But it's far from amazing. The controls are intentionally clunky, the games get stale quickly, some of the games can be cheesed and at least one is outright broken for one team (again, probably intentionally).

It's okay if you want to run with something for a very short stint, but you won't feel at all like you're getting hooked and need more more more. It's more of a timewaster, almost like playing a game on your phone.

Considered a refund, but being the video game connoisseur I am, I gave it a few days for my palette to be cleansed and gave it another shot.

Not only my issues, they are experienced by many of my friends and other other players. This is just appalling considering the amount I paid for this insult to the industry. Seems like Fall Guys died faster in Oceania faster than PUBG. Aside from my personal experience, the game is just excessively repetitive and boring.

"I honestly really hate this game. In concept it sounds fun but in reality its a nightmare. Its so frustrating to lose, not because of your own failures or mess ups, but because of your opponents. I cant honestly tell if this game is trying to be a fun party game or a slightly more competitive game, either way, it fails at both in my opinion. Now obviously i dislike this game, but i understand why others may enjoy it. So if you hate losing because your opponents are bad, then this game is probably not for you, but if you just want to run around and see what crazy stuff happens during matches and just kinda want to mess around, you might like the game. Hope this review was helpful. Have a great day.",False

"This game is a example of why steam needs a mixed rating. I ended up giving this game a thumbs down not because I nessasarily think it deserves it, but I also do not think it deserves its very positve reviews. I will not go in depth on why I LIKE this game, you can read any other review for that. instead, I will be touching on what needs to be fixed for this to become a amazing game.

[h1]To Start[/h1]

These are a few things I really LIKE about Fall Guys

[list]
[*]Innovative. like mario party but with more people.
[*]Colorful. digg the art style
[*]Microtranactions are not shitty.
[*]Rewards winning
[*]Laid back, but also slightly competitive
[*]games are short
[/list]


I also want to mention, I think this game has potential, its just not there yet.

[h1]The Team Games[/h1]

So. I want you to picture doing AMAZING in the past two rounds. you got in the top 20% at the start, and breezed through a survival stage. then a team game comes. 

you need to essentially rely on your teammates. you alown can not carry, so skill is not a factor here. your essentially relying on RNG to help you get to the next stage. but the problems do not end here.

[h2]FUCK U YELLOW! [/h2]

If your on the yellow team, you have a 50% chance to be screwed. fall people hate yellow for some reason.

[h2]Its not so much about winning, but instead, not losing.[/h2]

lets say the team game you got has 3 teams. yellow, red, and blue. blue has a bad start, and are far back. yellow and red in most circomstances will treaty, and both just target blue... because as long as blue dies, both red and yellow will move on. in a team game, no one cares about winning, they just don't want to lose.

[h1]The lack of content in general[/h1]

there is 25 maps in the game, but consitering some are late game, and your often ellimintated by then, your chances of seeing more than the same 10 over and over again are slim. its not that the maps are well designed, it just gets old... fast. fall guys needs probably 3x the ammount of maps to near endless fun.

[h1]Don't get me started on hackers[/h1]

Look, I get it. fall guys was not expected to be this popular. this is not REALLY the devs fault, but the game is significantly less fun because of it.

however bad you think it is, its worse. 

there is at lease one hacker a lobby.

hacks include: No gravity, AntiKB, Incredable speed (we are talken flash levels), Instent win, instent win for OTHERS (hackers can teleport you to the end bassicly), high jump (as high as they want), and pretty much everything else possible.

this is because currently on the server side there is no validation on the server side. what ever the client (you) tell the server is consitered correct. the server has zero anti cheat, and does not even run math to see if what your sending is correct.

they are working on it, but until it is fixed, you better love hackers.

[h1]Conclution[/h1]

Fall guys is fun right now, but it would be so much better when these 3 major issues are fixed.

maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10.

"This game has so much potential to be the next best multiplayer game. The variety of minigames is tremendous and the core mechanics are so easy to learn that pretty much anyone can pick it up.

On PC there are a few issues however:
1. Hackers - To be in a game without a hacker is a miracle. You can easily tell which players are cheating, because they zip around the course at impossible speeds. Also, in jumping minigames, they might fall of the platform, but then they spring right back up. Unfortunately, at this time, nothing can be done, because they don't have protection like other multiplayer games such as Team Fortress 2 do. In addition:
2. Lack of Unique Names - This is an issue that the developers have claimed they are working on, but currently PC players are unable to use their steam names in game. This means that we are unable to report any hackers.
3. Bad Servers - The developers are a very small company and do not have the resources yet to have servers that can hold all of the players. It sometimes takes a while to get into a game that you don't immediately get disconnected from.
4. Minigame Variety - I mentioned earlier that the minigame variety is amazing. This is, however, if the randomizer is working properly. Depending on they day, I might play the same game 4 times in a row (upon starting a new episode). 
5. The Grab Function is broken - One of the main functions of this game is being able to grab both the other players and anything in your environment. Unfortunately, sometimes the function doesn't work properly. One moment I will fail to grab someone right next to me, but someone else will grab me from a very far distance. This sucks in games that require grabbing. 

If you don't care about winning a bunch, this game is great. I might even say the best mutiplayer game that isn't an FPS. I think all of these issues will be fixed in due time. The developers are new, but I'm sure they are working hard. This is a great game to play with friends, and honestly even by yourself.",True

"pretty epic game if you're into beans, they are kinda hot, not gonna lie",True
"So many HACKERS. Literally every other game I join there is a hacker. What is the point when there can only be one winner? Many times they hide their hacks and then use them on the final game. No easy way to report people either. The games modes are alright, definitely need to add more variety, but the hacking just ruins the entire experience.",False

"FLY GUYS: The Ultimate Cheaters!

I really had a high hope for this game. But I don't think the devs have the same opinions as me.",False
"This game has a lot of potential and is a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend this game, if it weren't for the fact that it's swarming with cheaters as of writing this review. This completely ruins the competitive aspect of the game, because as long as there is 1 cheater among the ~60 people that you start out with, your chances of winning are immediately thrown out the window. Do not buy this game until they resolve this issue (if the developers will be able to, that is).

It leaves a bad taste in my mouth to leave a negative review for this reason, as this isn't necessarily the developers' fault. However, the cheaters completely ruin the experience for me, and I'm pretty sure a lot of other people would agree.",False
"The game play for this game is good, however I've had too many hackers ruin rounds for me to not refund it. If it was £5 or £10 maybe I could live with it, but for £16, I expect a relatively good anti-cheat given that the only thing you can do is battle-royale. Maybe I'll come back to this game at some point if I find out the cheating stops.

The devs have said that chances are if you see someone hacking it will either be their first or last time because of the anti cheat in it. Calling bull**** on that.",False
"I love this game.
It's quirky but enticing enough to keep you trying over and over.
HOWEVER, within the last few weeks I've been getting hackers in 90%+ of my games.
They teleport to the finish line, fly, push people off whilst going really fast and with that there's no chance to win or enjoy the game as you should. 

And I wonder if teleporting to the finish line and waiting for everyone else to finish is actually fun? But I guess it finally gives them an opportunity to make top 40 lol.

However, for now, I would wait to see how server management evolves before buying it.",False
боб,True
Fun game but there are too many hackers right now and there is no report system. Always lose in final round because of hackers.,False
"Currently a very fun game but gets ruined by hackers and bad latency/lag/desynch issues where players are not actually where they are on your screen but somewhere ahead of them, resulting in things like getting your tail stolen from 3-4 body lengths away or jumping to hit a ball in a very important game and going right through it. 

      As of 9/9/20 there is a 50%+ chance you will have 1 or more people hacking in your game resulting in very very little opportunity for you to compete. Lastly Review subject to updates but very little has changed at this point since release. 
     
      Lastly, there is often very little deviation in what games you get to play. There is a good variety of fun ones, but some of the boring and unfun maps pop up super frequently such as Fall ball and the memorization mini game. The biggest problem is that they get repetitive and boring very quickly. Other ""survival"" based games can also quickly just become boring waiting out a clock type situations which are unfun. 

     Overall game play is an 8/10 but hacks and lag bring it down to a solid 4.",False

The community management response to this issue is also terrible, discouraging reporting hackers/cheaters or even talking about the problem, just to keep up a good image.
This could be a good game in the future, but in its current state I cannot recommend it.",False
When it works it is a fun battle royal with a tad little content. The servers are a mess right now and it's definitely not fun playing every once in a while when the server crashes in round 4 and you get no kudos and exp.

"Fall guys is a fantastic game this game is very unique and it brings something new to the table in the battle royale genre i will be going over the pros and cons of this game so let's get on with this review.!

GRAPHICS: The graphics of fall guys is very bright and beatiful looking i love the art style that is used in this game hands down looks jaw dropping amazing graphically speaking for a 2020 game.


GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is smooth and fun throughout my entire time playing not once did i feel like i was fighting with the game which is a big plus also the game mechanics are very easy and simple which is great since this game is very noobie friendly when it comes down to it's basic gameplay/controls i wouldn't say that this game is a walk in the park you will need to practice getting good at this game however for controls and genral gameplay mehcanics it's very simple.

PROS: The game is is for everyone who likes battle royale styled games and or are just looking for something new and unique 

The game it optimized on pc not once did i notice any poor optimization issues with this game which is a huge plus for me.

The game aging looks beatiful!

Load times are fast as in when ever you die or get elimenated from a match the load times for finding another match is very fast which is fantastic since after you lose each time it's not really a big deal as you won't need to wait forever to get into another match.

CONS: The only main issue i have with this game is that well since it is a new game and it's been getting a ton of traction sadly from my time playing this game i've noticed that there is a ton of cheaters in this game lately which sucks because everyone else will be playing the game normally without cheats and you will get one person who will just teleport themselves from the starting line to the finish line which breaks the entire point of the game it ruines the fun for everyone else. 

There is no way to report cheaters in the game sadly as of this writing which sucks because the cheaters are going crazy and no one can do a thing about it supposably the devs have a anti cheat in place however i personally feel like this anti cheat system needs to be updated very soon or else this game will  lose a ton of it's playerbase. 

CONCLUSSION: So after reading my review should you buy fall guys? i would have to say this i would not reccomend that you get this game if this is going to be like your first pc game or only game that you will be playing as i think you will be disapointed not with the game itself but just with the bucnh of cheaters who wil ruine your time with the game if you can overlook the cheater issue though than you have a fantastic game here that i would personally reccomend it's very fun to play by yourself or with firends. I give fal guys 9/10 paws.",True
"This game is very fun in concept. The mini-games are entertaining but can get repetitive. They need to add more mini-games, or just do something more with the game. It is plagued with UI and game connection bugs too. I will change my review in the future if these issues are addressed.",False
Very fun game until you meet hackers,True
"It gets boring really fast. I played it for 2.7 hours and it got boring, dont buy!",False
"Pros: 
Most levels are fun.
Colors/graphics are nice.

Cons:
Very few levels. 
99% of the players are trolls.
The levels where you're forced to be on a team should just be removed completely. Most people troll their own team forcing you to lose.
Hackers are in almost every game. You'll see 1 or 2 players literally fly and reach the finish line within seconds of the game starting. 
If you make it through to the last stage, when you lose, it feels like the time you just put into all of the stages were pointless. Even when you do win, you get a crown, which you can get just from leveling, so why try to win? The rewards are so bare minimum it seems like you're working toward nothing.",False

When you fall over on the floor, it feels really not good. When you don't fall over, and instead make it to the end and win, it feels like um really good. I've never actually made it to the end because well my internet isn't good and my computer is a toaster and my mum is a b****, but yeah oh well. I laugh every time my friend falls over, and he gets really angry, because he just fell over. You should buy this game if you also like laughing and people falling over, if you don't like laughing, then maybe play minecraft, another great classic title. Also just a side note, chicken and beef burgers taste weird.",True

"Fall Guys is the perfect “party” game to play with friends or solo. Its vast range of mini games reel players in, and keep them hooked due to the “next time,” mindset. However, its major flaw and ultimate drag-down is the fact that people are able to hack the game for a competitive advantage, and there is no option to report said hackers. This causes major frustration among genuine players, especially in final modes where hackers are able to hover above to the finish line, or to stay above the goo the longest. This is a key point that the developers need to work on for Season 2; an option to report other players is a critical feature for an online game. Overall, I would highly recommend this game for casual and hardcore gamers alike, and due to it being a game you can pick up for a quick round here and there, it’s definitely worth the money.",True

Half the time the physics are clunky and feel like it's a mobile game. All of the games are extremely repetetive and you will experience everything the game will have to offer after 5 games tops, after that you can do is grind wins to get crowns or just to buy Kudos for real money. Furthermore, anticheat for the game is basically non-existent, and hackers have a guaranteed win. Hopefully they improve it at Season 2 launch, when I'll probably change my review, until then, it just isn't worth the twenty dollar price tag.",False

This game is extremely fun. It's simplistic design makes it approachable to more casual gamers and not focus on complex strats and decisions.

"What I dislike about the game. Hm lets see. As most Multiplayer games where only 1 is the winner you will lose alot and win very little unless you are lucky/skilled or all around perfect at it in every way.

Second. There is no Silver or Bronze reward for crowns. Which makes the game grinding and feel like a chore. Once you played all the minigames that there is, you start to feel the effects on you even more so if you don't win any crowns within 12 hours or more of streaming said game. 

3rd Tryhards like myself ruin the game for the casual base. Ultimately having only 1 winner all throughout and no podium kills the joy of playing this game  if you make a mistake on the final stages. Simply put the kudos given for your efforts will not make you happy and don't get me started on the transactions for the items in game. 

Also I been noticing users with tall body outfits like Hotdog or Slushee drinks have advantages over Fall Ball when bumping it in the air. 

Not until Mediatonic starts to giving more players more rewards in time invested in it. I am dropping this game.  Uninstalled til further notice.

Multiplayer games get boring without any friends to play with anyways.",False
"[h1]UPDATE:[/h1]
[b]-- September 19th --[/b]
Currenty, the problems with cheaters are fixed! There are still problems with lag but they tend to occur only on ""grab-a-tail"" games.
They've also added random modifications to the levels so they're not the same on every round, giving the game a lot of replayability.

7/10

[b]-- August 27th --[/b]
[strike]The game is awesome. It's super fun to play with friends or even solo. Although the price tag (19.99€) is a bit high for the content that the game currently offers, developers are working hard to add more content and listen to the players.[/strike]

[strike]Unfortunately, it's not enough.[/strike]

[strike]Hackers are seen too frequently in the game and it totally ruins the experience. It feels frustrating watching how a flying guy catches the crown every 2 or 3 matches.[/strike]

[strike]On the other side we have the lag issues. It's not a big problem, but it's totally noticeable on the ""grab-a-tail"" modes. The other players catch your tail from too far, but you need to get super close to grab them.[/strike]

[strike]I'll change my review when these problems get addressed properly, but in the current state, it's a [b]No[/b].[/strike]",True

"Fun, addictive game. The type of game you can just go on when you're bored",True
"whilst other developers are busy developing and releasing some other boring battle royale games with boring guns whatsoever, this game came out with a fresh and very colorful content. although the game concept as a whole isnt purely original it is groundbreaking to an extent. this is the type of game that i would play together with my friends on friday nights only to have fun and entertain ourselves. even though everything within the game is fully decorated with colorful and bubbly ornaments, it is still basically a competitive game and is pretty stressful sometimes (those team games am i right) but still fun nonetheless. 

so far the game still has a lot of things to be fixed like their cheat protection that's barely there and the servers connection problems. this game has the potential to be developed into something more than just what it already is, like if the developer considered to add a only-friends lobby feature or allow us to play together with more than four people in one party that would be totally cool i believe everyone would love that. 

and so far i love it, really. i dont see it as a game that would die within the next few years just because nobody is hyping it anymore. i totally recommend this game and im looking forward to seeing the development of this game, i have faith in everyone who's constantly working and developing this game, the level designers and the rest of the team involved.

 I love this game, between the hilarious rag doll mechanics and the ridiculous outfits (or the ugly hot dog) and just the genuinely fun game modes, it's an amazing grab for 20 macaroons. 
I have encountered a couple of bugs including falling through platforms however it is a very rare occurrence.
This game definitely has a place in the future and I am super excited to see what is coming up!

A battle royale game where only one play can win should not have a single team game in it because you lose only based on how much your own team does bad or purposely trys to fail making the whole point of the game pointless and not worth it when you have to rely on a team not being stupid or trolling and for your team to get the advantage based on luck of players in squads tipping team games to force one team to have 1 or 2 or even 3 less players for a squad to be in one team but for the other 3 rounds just be better then everyone else. also many people hacking giving themselves higher speed and higher jumps so they cant lose making the game not worth the price and would only be worth if it was a free game and the game even comes with microtransactions for skins which isnt that bad but the least they could do after making you buy the game that has the quality of a free game is have any ability to report players or to stop/ban people who just cheat making the game unplayable. constant desync makes the entirety of the grabbing mechanic not work with players being to far away yet grabbing and taking your tail or jynxing you while trying to grab players many times are near impossible making them win just because they didnt stay still no matter how well you pursue them. do not buy this game at all wait until you know the problem of cheating is dealt with and probably buy it on sale its still not worth its base price even if they remove cheaters and fix desync. its clear to see issues with the games physics not working right and problems with the game like glitches making it unable to leave a game even when youve lost and you cant pause or leave making you wait and watch or alt f4 to get out. games fun but not well designed and feels rushed with how everything is and doesnt deserve your money. the game doesnt even have a report function for players who are trolling and throwing games or for hackers either so no one usually will see any repercussion for doing such things as well as players quitting mid game and making their team suffer get no punishment. many of the minigames that make up fall guys have incredible issues and are majority just luck based if you are to win or lose with the poor inconsistent physics of the game makes balls and eggs and launched fruit interact in ways you know it shouldnt as well as spawning in further rows changing the entire outcome of a race making you lose by a hair because you didnt get the front row. some minigames have a tendency to appear way more then others such as fall ball and fall mountain making them boring and repetitive as they show up way more often then other games.,False

It gets a 6 because it has some flaws, not competitive enough to truly be a competitive game so it makes it more of a party game, however it lacks many party game features. No offline mode, no ability to play couch co-op, no ability to practice/play specific maps, etc. Also there's not enough maps, once you've played for a day or two (or in my case ~4 hours) you've played every map multiple times and basically have the ones you're good at and will almost always qualify in and the ones you're bad at (a couple maps I've literally never made it to the end). The only type of game mode with multiple maps is the race to the finish line, and they're not really all that different. Still really fun though.",True

"Fall Guys
I got the game and on my first session I came in first place. I should've stopped there. I then spent 4 more hours on the game which has felt like an eternity. At first it was good fun and games, but it slowly became what it had kept hidden; a cruel, heartless hellscape where every bastard man is put towards a common goal and will do anything that it takes to win. Anything. I've caused the death of many people and others have done the same to me. The pure black pupils are the last thing you see before being sent into the void or the ever growing pit of hot pink cum sauce. They've tried many times to put in gamemodes that promote ""teamwork"", if it can even be called that. Nobody is your friend in this game. They allow you a party of up to 4 other players, but even then you will be alone while playing. Everything is fucked, but I haven't even started on Fall Mountain. Fall Mountain is the unwanted fetus of any teenage girl and brings out the same level of hatred whenever anyone gets put on this level. There is one stage that nobody dies on. Everyone's spirits are lifted when shown this stage, but I have learned it's cruel, twisted intentions. If nobody dies on that level, then the next one needs to eliminate even more people. The gods of Fall Guys are unforgiving and they make sure to remind you every single time you think you are safe. They will put you into a trance and forever keep you within their grasp with their addictive concepts. Meanwhile, they force you into games of shame by making you WANT to take a furry fox tail off of someone and shove it into your own ass. If you refuse their order and don't do as their will commands, then you are immediately impaled straight through the heart and will be forced into yet another game. Not because you want to, but because you need to. They dangle gifts right in front of your face in the form of a battle pass to keep you in and never leave. The rings of hell are real and Fall Guys is the very last one.

All in all, 10/10, would cry again",True
game does not work.,False
"The game is extremely fun to play! Sort of addicting too. Not that I haven't seen these kind games on smartphones earlier, but the characters, the animations and the visuals couple with the concept of 50+ players in a single game competing against each other has given this concept better traction and hype.

The character voices and their action physics/animations make them look funny and cute. The ability to customise the appearance can help you set your character apart from the crowd. It gives you a feeling that you sort of have a unique character running around, although, there could be another that could, coincidently, look exactly like yours or very similar to it.

There are very bugs here and there and a few limitations and missing features that devs need to address. Your character gets a 4-digit code instead of a username of your choice. This makes it hard to track your friends in game. To put it briefly, it makes the whole thing a bit confusing. There's no in-game chat feature as yet. Maybe if we could have a post-game chat room too where we could all discuss where each of went wrong, or even make new friends to play with, That would make it even more fun! Talking of friends, you don't have a list of in-game friends, or a list that you could invite from within the game for that matter. You have to open the Steam overlay and invite them from your Steam friends list. There should be an in-game list of who is online and who is playing and an option to invite them from there, directly.

For the price this game comes at, I'd expect the devs to add a new level/map every week, or every month at most. This will the keep the game interesting and populated. All-in-all, highly fun to play and highly recommended!",True

"If you want a TL;DR, I'll just say that I've been writing all this between rounds. (Also, if you're hesitant because of all the stories of people struggling to get into any Episodes, it's a temporary issue caused by the developers underestimating Devolver Digital's formidable marketing and PR, and they have plenty of resources available to deal with it. Don't let that put you off!)

Fall Guys presents an alternative to the battle royale establishment by throwing sixty players at a time into an ""Episode"", a series of minigames including obstacle courses, team matches and memory games. A certain number of players can ""qualify"" in each round, and the final round is one last free-for-all. There can only be one true winner, but it's all done with an exuberant, positive atmosphere that has you feeling mildly bad at worst when you lose (which you will). Getting your first crown is exhilarating though, and makes all your past strife worth it.

Fall Guys' design perfectly suits casual gaming, with little time investment per Episode and no emphasis on ""gitting gud"". Contests last around ten minutes from start to finish. The most skilled players will often see their dreams crushed by rivals interfering on purpose or otherwise. In each qualifying round, you don't have to be the best - just good enough. A couple of hours is all it takes for you to not worry about the first round any more. Improving your platforming skill is the only thing (within the terms of service) that will give you ""an edge"" in Fall Guys. The only items you earn are cosmetics, and for now, that's enough of a reward, but down the line MEDIATONIC might have to invent some other way to entice players. Looks are a big part of Fall Guys and its myriad cosmetics fit perfectly into its deceptively cute bubblegum-bouncy-castle aesthetic. Losing but earning enough for a new cosmetic does soften the blow, though usually when I lose in the final I just feel respect for the winner, regardless of the luck or dirty tactics that probably got them to that point.

Importantly for me, Fall Guys feels like it wants me to keep playing. When you lose, you can quit at lightning speed, grab your reward and jump straight into a new Episode (assuming the servers aren't being hammered anyway). Your reward is proportional to your success. Fame points go towards levelling up, and every level gives you either currency or cosmetics. The currencies are Kudos, which you can earn through normal gameplay or paying extra, and crowns, which you win by hitting certain levels or winning the final. Getting to the final will net you a few hundred Kudos, and cosmetics cost upwards of 1000, so it's about half an hour's play for a colour pattern and two hours for one piece of the two-piece costumes. ""Legendary"" items cost crowns instead, but I won my first crown 11 hours in. Those who bought at launch and missed out on the Gordon Freeman pre-order had about two days to win ten crowns for the Alyx Vance costume after launch - practically impossible. I think it wouldn't hurt MEDIATONIC to be more generous with their Kudos and especially crown prices: it wouldn't cost them anything; it's fairer to casual players who don't have so much spare time; the players have paid good money to be here already; the game is wildly more popular and therefore lucrative than they expected; they have a huge and growing variety of purchasable cosmetics that they don't even need to design themselves - the fans send in designs for them!

I wouldn't have spent so long with this game if the gameplay wasn't its own reward. Almost all rounds are great fun, though a few become a bit of a waste of time as potentially everyone can qualify. Generally levels are the same every time - though the unpredictable movement of your rivals keeps you on your toes - but I think going forward they should all be randomised or tweaked every so often, as the player skill level increases and everyone remembers the map layouts. A season lasts 60 days but you can see all the available levels so far in your first five or so hours of play. MEDIATONIC will probably need to churn out new maps at least every season to renew players' interest, but it's probably impossible to launch a seasonal battle royale without some ridiculously detailed content schedule so I'm sure there will be plenty more content to come.

Really, how could there not be - half an hour with this game and you may well start brainstorming game modes you'd like to see. There's so much potential with platforming minigames - I'm personally hoping for a game where each team controls a giant fighting mech, some difficult shortcuts involving grabbing rope swings, a Squads mode and maybe a challenging single player campaign that provides some extra currency. I think the future of this game is as bright as its colourful world, and I can't wait to see what comes next.",True

"This game holds up a mirror to today's society and its disgusting glorification of personal gain. It shines a spotlight on the depths that can be reached by human depravity, selfish greed, and the innate moral corruption deep within our soul.

10/10 would grab people at the finish line again.",True

Super fun & well worth the price...!",True
"WORST GAME EVER!!

I hate this game so much. First of all there is way too many furries who think its okay to grab me
Fix your stupid severs do you think i enjoy getting disconnected mid game. Take off teams i shouldn't have to rely of garbage players, and if you don't take off teams make it fair and make the team players even in game. Also take people with trash WIFI off this game how can someone take my tail away when there like 5 ft away from me are we social distancing in the game as well, but i have to be right next to them to take there's away. Overall fall guys just falls flat on its face.",False

worth it",True
"I've fallen, and I can't get up!",True
"Dear holy Satan why did the devs go for winning based currency, the game has a ridiculous amount of speedhackers and trolls. Not to mention server issues, sometime you'll be unable to login, sometime you'll get kicked out of a game, if you're queuing with a friend you have a 10% chance to end up in completely different games, just because. You can spend as much money as you'd like on the in-game currency -  if you want a crown suit you need to get very very lucky, and freaking fast no less. Or just give up and accept defeat. 

But goddamn if it isn't a stupid amount of fun, hard to understand how it took so long for Takeshi's Castle to become a game.  Preordered this as soon as I saw the trailer at Devolverland Expo and my biggest complaint is that it didn't release with co-op. It's fun as a battle royale but seeing your drunk friends get knocked over and over and over by these rotating hammers? Priceless.",True

Best battle royale this world's ever fucking seen.,True
Cheaters in every game,False
Honestly not worth $19. Feels like it coulda been made in unity a week and the networking seems to have had as much effort put in,False
This game is great very fun to play over and over the only negative thing I would put is some maps are less fun than others ofc... but when they add new maps it should be even more fun so yeah great game to buy,True
give me playable server plz,False
Very fun and entertaining! Keeps you occupied for hours on end!,True
Great game but the main problem is that some maps have an 80% occurrence rate and I've played them 500 times while some others I haven't even seen or played once. Also please minimize the chance of team games happening. Every game doesn't need to have a team match!,True
super fun c:,True
One of the most fun games I've played in over years. Great fun solo or in a party with your friends.,True
Nice,True
I am dying from laughing so hard! Best game to play by yourself or with friends! Had a great time!,True
"Fall guys as a game concept is amazing and a great idea, but as many people have said repeating the same games over and over loses its charm. Outside of the server performance there are still a bug that forces you to exit the game wich can really ruin the flow. Honestly i would wait maybe a few more months before this game is fully polished and ready to be played",False
alright. needs more maps,True
"This game is pretty fun. Almost all of the mini games are good, especially if you play a bit and get to know the ends and outs. The egg mini game is probably the only one that I would say is sub par. Since only one team can prevail, when a team starts to fall in eggs the two other teams usually gang up on the lesser team, guaranteeing that the lesser team will be the one that's eliminated. If you're team falls short in the beginning it usually means you're not coming back.",True
"Fall Guys is the BR I have been waiting for! All my years of Mario Party have led me to this day!
A great game that is just pure fun! There aren't a ton of levels right now, but I know they will be coming out with more as time passes.",True
Fun until you start losing because of your team and the random balancing,False

The game modes are fun and are very easy to pick up. I would recommend people to buy and play this game with friends to have the best experience possible,",True
"Very cute and fun. However, as of writing, the game has some issues with servers booting you out in-between rounds, which can really suck when you've made it far, but presumably this issue will get ironed out before long. It can be played with a mouse and keyboard just fine, but I'd recommend a controller for the best experience.",True
A really interesting take on the Battle Royale genre. Very fun and not as infuriating as other games with similar objectives. It takes me back to the time I used to play in minigames servers from Counter-Strike: Source.,True
"Takeshi’s Castle x Cartoon animations and 50 other players why wouldn’t you love it.

good,True
"Finally a BR that's actually fun to play, props to the indie company that made it!",True
"This game is an absolute blast to play, especially if you buddy up with friends. Any of the server issues from game launch are definitely fixed by now, so matchmaking is a breeze, the visuals and audio mix wonderfully and suit the gameplay perfectly, and honestly, if you're not laughing even when you lose, I don't know what to tell you (unless on you're playing See Saw, in which case everyone around you is probably bad and can't teamwork very well)",True
"The fact that they did so many beta tests and had public testing and still somehow failed to overhaul team games into anything remotely fun baffles me. It's completely mad to me that their idea of good game design to not at least limit team games to rounds that have balanced numbers. How am I suppose to win the rolling ball team game when my team has one less player then other teams. It's literally impossible, we are missing the push power of a person you can't make that up unless the other team afk's. I just can't fathom what mindset you had to be in to think allowing unbalanced teams was a good idea. Do you have the slightest clue how unsatisfying it is to make it to round 4 only to auto lose because your team is missing a member. It's just not good design. Otherwise the game is pretty good it's quick and fun the grabbing controls could be a little tighter but that's it. I'll change my review if and when they actually fix team games.",False
Fuck team games and fuck yellow,True
good,True
This game is sheer .... freaking....gold. you are missing out if you didn't have this game 4 hours ago.,True
Fun,True
One of the best games ive played in a long time honestly.,True

good game to play with friends,True
So good and pog,True
"This game is so good, even if you fail you have tons of fun!

The art and music is so perfect for this game.  Just sitting in the game lobby can put a smile on your face.

The challenges look so simple until you're in them and then it really feels like you're fighting for your life.  I don't think any other game has got my palms sweating and adrenaline pumping in a good while.

It would be nice to have bigger party sizes at some point because everyone I know wants to play this together.  Listening to your friends reactions during this game is pure joy.

I would, and am, recommending this game to everyone I know.",True
"This game is both wacky and insanely fun. Sure, some may be rage-inducing, but it is still an overall fun game. I totally recommend this for those who like party games.",True
"So pleasing to the eyes with the beautiful colors. Addicting music. I have so much fun with my friends. It's like we're watching sports and having scream battles. 

The big negative is you can only team up with 4 people and there are no private sessions.",True

"Super fun, engaging game. You're a bean playing Wipeout/Ninja Warrior/Whatever on a massive scale.

Get to falling.",True
very fun game just remove team games horrible idea its just whoever has more experienced players wins. otherwise its extremely fun and has really cute characters and outfits that you can get for free which makes it better. once more game modes get added this game will get better and better,True

Beautiful and fun game. Silliness combined with a solid play style. This will be my go to when i need something quick and fun. Well done friends!,True
"This is the funnest game I have played in a long time. It's so easy to have a great time with a few friends playing these mini games together. I've been looking for something like this since Fusion Frenzy lol. Keep it up, I will be playing this so much!",True
fun game. there are server issues but no doubt its gonna get fixed. i believe. why? i can see that the devs care. devs that are doing it just for the sake of it wouldn't have given us such a colourful game and i'm not just talking about the looks.,True
"This is a very good game.  There are some teething problems on the first day, as you would expect from any game with 60 players in a session together.  These will go away soon, and what is left is immensely enjoyable and joyful.  Highly recommended.",True
Fun game! Love it!,True
this game has that thing we cannot talk about on internet...its...fun,True
Funny game with funny Jellybean c:,True
"Its a great fun and casual game, only issue atm is there isnt much support for groups or parties larger than 4. Would be ideal for things to do with bigger groups of friends. Custom lobbies and gamemodes etc",True
"Really fun mix on the battle royal genre! Very fun and a great party game, would very much recommend!",True
there are guys and they fall,True
I don't leave reviews often but hot damn this game is freaking amazing! It's just pure fun! Fast match-making and quick games mean you spent little time waiting and all the time playing!,True
Amazing game. Makes me rage in the best possible ways.,True
"Good goofy fun to play with friends. There are a decent amount of maps and game modes at the moment but the game could benefit from either random level generation for the obstacle courses or workshop support. There have been some server issues at launch but I will give them the benefit of the doubt on this and assume they will clear up.

The two weaknesses of the game are that the maximum party size appears to be 4, I believe this game would be exponentially more fun the more people you have in a party. 

The second weakness is that the team based modes are OKAY, it can feel a little unfair if your team are useless despite you doing well and you get eliminated. I think a better way to handle this would be for the game modes with more than two teams that the winning team is safe and that the worst 50% of players out of the other teams are eliminated. This would allow players who played well while in a bad team can still continue to the next round.",True
Fun game obviously has teething problems at the moment with day 1 launch but really fun.,True
plain fun,True
Fun game with lots of potential to become big,True
"Fun game, there was some first day online connection issues but sorted out now.",True
"Game is fun, especially the race stages. But when it comes to the team stages, it gets unfun real quick",True
STOP GRABBING ME,True
Game is extremely fun. Not loads of variety yet but the game is new and the devs have already said they are working on new levels and features. There are some server issues at the moment which some people can't seem to realise doesn't define the game. Play the game before leaving a negative review.,True

"This game is good, first day at launch had some problems but still a good game which you can have fun in with your friends :)",True
Just a really fun thing,True
Game is Poggers,True
"Game is great, has a lot of potential and is a lot of fun. It is normal that at launch date with thousands of players the servers will get fç%/*, but still, the game and idea is great, it has a lot of potential and If the devs keep on getting stuff out, I dont see why it should be one of my fav to go games for chilling in the night =)",True
"really awesome game 
worth playing solo or with friends 
it gets easy 9.5/10
",True
"Okay YES THIS GAME HAS SOME SERVER ISSUES RIGHT NOW Thats just a result of mediatonic not realising how many people will love this game.
So yes right now you may struggle to get into a match, they're working there asses off.
As for the game itself? Amazingly fun! I've been playing for the last hour with near enough no issues, and its such a great time! Its a battle royale that doesnt take itself seriously and is just generally fun to play!

So should you buy this game? That honestly depends on your patience. Can you wait for them to fix the servers before giving a negative review? Then absolutely it is so much fun and you will enjoy this game when it works.

If you can't wait for them to fix the servers, hold off for a few days at least to see it improve. 
This is a very fun game :3",True
"This is the revival that BR needed! The game is really good other than a few launch issues but they've said that they're gonna work on it asap! They've been doing the best they can to make the servers work and I guess some people cant be patient. The game is very fun! Cosmetics make the game really cool and free battle pass is very nice! Honestly don't listen to the negative reviews, the game WILL get better, the developers ARE committed to the craft! I would give it an 8/10 because there is some stuff they need to work on. Overall I would totally purchase this and play it with friends! If you cant find any friends then it works by yourself equally as well.",True
"It's a good game.

Stop being a cuck and review bombing just because it's release day and they didn't expect the popularity.",True
"Not right now. It needs a lot of polishing, content, etc.

It'll be worth it in a year for sure.",False
"The game is a pure boost of serotonin! Played the beta for hours and my face hurt from how much I was smiling.
 And the fact that they are planning more to add more games and seasonal content games/cosmetics is a win in my books. This is the start of something really great.",True
pretty cool,True
"Fun simple, easy to play with friends.",True
"Haven't got in yet but if you review bomb this game from an indie studio because its a bit rocky on the launch day then you're brain dead

Edit: played it and its good just needs extra content over time",True
"I played several hours during the beta and loved it, I had to pick it up as soon as it came out. If you like wipeout or takashi's castle you'll enjoy this game.",True
Pretty good,True
love this game so fun more people should get it cause its just fun party mini games,True
"Fun game to play with friends, currently it has server problems due to too many players, but it seems like that will be over soon (hopefully)",True
An amazingly fun game that I really hope will only get bigger and bigger. It absolutely deserves peoples attention!,True
Хвать за попу,True
My only gripe is people are too busy running into you rather than going for the finish line :P  This game is STUPID fun and addicting.,True
"Finally got hands on this game after watching streamers played it, I absolutely love the animation and design.On my first few games I experienced connection timeout, it got fixed as soon as i restart the game. Hope this game will grow in the long run! Join their discord to get more info.",True

Guy falls haha,True
best BR game by far. warzone? never met her,True
"They literally had 2 beta weekends to figure out the bugs, still has disasterous launch, servers are constantly down/ being maintenanced, bugs such as controllers not working, not being able to exit a match, not getting your rewards, getting kicked out of a game with no reason, and theres probably more.  The game WOULD be super fun if it worked, but I cannot recommend at this time.  Also they dont listen to the community about team games, literally NO ONE wants them",False
"I think it's a well rounded game, but sometimes you get in some games with hackers. Nothing you can do about it expect hope they're on a losing team.",True

There's no possiblity to reconnect, and any XP accumulated is lost.

Screen ratio is quite restrictive (forget ultrawide or anything larger) as well.

There's a lot of potential, the game's a lot of fun, but it doesn't seem ready for prime time yet, it feels like it's early access.

"The game is fun but....

-Team games are cancerous and unfun.  I dread every one I get into.  The least awful one is the soccer one but even this is miserable half of the time because teams are uneven.  Please remove all team games.  Thanks.

-The grabbing tail mechanic is inconsistent and awful.  I have grabbed the tail off another player from two character lengths away.  I have also been grinding on some dude's thigh for 12 seconds, unable to grab the tail.  Though I do love grinding on dudes, not getting the tail after a solid decade of being on top is disheartening. 

-Servers have gotten better yes, but I still disconnect every few games.  Additionally I have been unable to queue into a game with a group.  

-Other issues regarding my characters hit box being the size of a huntress hatchet from DBD (for those fortunate enough to not have played DBD, trust me when I say her hatchets are the size of a semi).  Also, my character just collapsing from having a stoke mid jump for no reason is super fun.  

Ill adjust my review once the game becomes less awful.",False
got eliminated in finals in under 0.5 seconds.,True
"I do enjoy this game. I got it for free from a great friend and I foresee myself playing this with my group in the future. However, for $20, this is not worth it. Especially when they are tacking on microtransactions, even if they are just cosmetic. If you play for an hour, you've played all of the modes. They desperately need more races and minigames. Some of the games just suck... the tail game is garbage -- the timer makes the round 90% useless until the last 10 seconds. Egg scramble, which is a lot of fun, has just turned into two teams bullying one team to guarantee they move forward. 

My biggest complaint is that you can't create private servers or play specific game modes with your friends. The multiplayer aspect of this game is awful. Lots of waiting and watching, almost 0 interaction, and parties are capped at 4 players...

I will happily change my review once things are ironed out. It's surprisingly fun at first, and I think that's where most of the reviews come from, but it lacks any depth. It's essentially a single player party game with a bunch of flaws right now. I would not pay more than $10 for this at the moment.",False
"While this game can be fun and entertaining for some, it is aimed primarily at kids. Due to this, it can be annoying as a bunch of toddlers, who aren't even able to speak yet, ruin the game. To get around this issue, the game should be rated for mature audiences only. There are several more major problems with the game that make it an unplayable pile of garbage. 
   For a unique and new battle royale game, you would think it would be a much better game than Fortnite. However, the game falls extremely short of what it could have been. It is not an enjoyable battle royale game as most of the time you have to bear with all of the toxic players. Similar with Fortnite, players are really sweaty and are tryhards. This is the reason I quit playing Fortnite. When I first saw this game, I was hoping it would be a different experience but I was dead wrong. This game is broken and filled with annoying children who have never played an actual video game (such as Shellshock Live).",False

Even if they are there they don't affect your experience so don't listen to the negative reviews from whiney people who are frustrated they suck.

This game really is an absolute blast. There is nothing more satisfying than winning a race or finally getting that crown but all the fun you have in between is priceless. Never had so much fun failing and the way it lets you just instantly fire into another round without delays is amazing and keeps you wanting more and more.

"Fall Guys is a really interesting game, however at this current stage in development I wouldn't say it's exactly playable. The servers are ass. 40% of the time I get disconnected before I even get in the game. Sometimes I'll be over halfway done with a match when all of a sudden I'm booted out for no reason. It's so frustrating thinking about how many potential wins I've lost due to shitty servers. If you plan on playing with a friend, get ready to wait 10 minutes before you can even hop into a queue. For some reason, running groups makes the disconnections even MORE frequent. Either one party will join the game while the other disconnects, or both will disconnect. 

The game modes are all mostly pretty good EXCEPT for fall ball. Holy shit, I hate fall ball. It's an rng clusterfuck to see who can score more points in the opposing team's goal. Your individual performance will hardly matter; it's all about whose teammates are more competent. This is the only mode I want flat out removed. There are some that need vast improvements (Memory game isn't hard or fun, most of the survival levels are too easy, obstacle courses have no variation) but fall ball takes the cake for the worst mini game. 

TL:DR: Game has tons of potential, but needs some serious polishing. I'd wait a couple of weeks for the servers to die down a bit, or until they roll out some content updates/patches.",False

"So, initial server issues aside (which this is actually a small indie company, so I'm surprised they handled it as quickly as they did), I decided this game deserves a review. Truth be told, I hate Battle Royale games. But I like Fall Guys.

Fall Guys is basically Wipe Out, Hole in The Wall, and American Ninja Warrior combined all into one cartoonish, hilarious clown fiesta of a 60-player minigame Battle Royale. 

Each game runs 4-5 rounds, which random events happening each round. The only guarantee is that the 1st round will be an obstacle course race or Door Bash.

The game's physics are cheesy, albeit sometimes buggy to the point of being exploitable. If you don't take the game too seriously, you'll find it's as enjoyable as Mario Party minigames, especially when you queue up with friends.

Edit #2:
Devs have been adding more final rounds and added more randomization to what the final event will be. Only consistency I noted is that the Tail Grab final event is limited to at most 6 people still, which makes sense given the small map.",True

In those 20 games:

I got to the final round (last 8-10 or so) in 5 of them.

Two other games disconnected and another had a hacker. 

Very fun game when not faced with these challenges, but if you're going to charge £16 for a multiplayer game like this, at the very least you should have working servers. A way to report players would be a great addition too, but I understand why this might be difficult to implement.

I'm not saying not to get the game, it's a lot of fun! But if you're on the fence, I'd wait until they address these issues and see if there'll be positive changes here.

TLDR: Really great game, but just a few very frustrating things that need to be fixed.",False
fucj,False
"Skill has it's weight but luck dictates what will happen in most matches, personally the bulk of the individual mini-games are good, even though some are quite uninspired and a chore after a while (looking at you memory game and block party, both eliminate very few people and aren't that fun at all). What is a real dealbreaker to me is forcing party games to get rid of the more experienced players, quoting the lead game designer FallGuysJoe on Reddit ""As mentioned below, it gives lower skilled players a chance to progress as part of a team."", your skill matters little in those team games and they are designed simply to randomly eliminate people. I don't mind losing because I screwed up, made bad call and so on, but being thrown out because the devs think that being skilled and investing our time to get to learn the game is a bad thing shocks me. Notice that the team game is usually before the final match, that's not random, they really meant it to be that way, quoting dev Joe again ""We want Fall Guys to be accessible for lots of players, and we like the way it gives people the chance to qualify who tend to go out in the 3rd/4th round."". There you go, they want you to lose on the team games.

TL;DR: The game is luck based by design, skill matters in the solo games but the team games are there to punish you and deny you the chance of winning so others can, regardless of skill.",False

"The Positives
+The game is fun, I really enjoy playing. The game is such a great concept.
+The bright and vibrant art style fits the game perfectly.

+The soundtrack is pretty darn good too.

The Negatives
-Microtransactions and day-one DLC in a game with an upfront cost is always disappointing, it’s unnecessarily greedy.
-Cheaters, there's loads of them. The anti-cheat, if it exists at all, doesn't work and that wouldn't be so bad if there was a way for players to manually report cheaters... but they can’t.
-The server latency, there's just way too much for this type of game. I can forgive this for now, since I’m pretty sure the game sold way better than anyone expected and this could be due to the servers being over capacity but expect improvement since it hurts the game overall and can make some mini-games near unplayable.
-There's not enough mini-games, I expect more are coming but as it currently stands I don’t feel there's £16 worth of game.
-Usernames are broken, currently all players display with a randomly generated name making it difficult to identify players.

In conclusion, while I really do enjoy the game, given the current flaws I can’t say I would recommend the game for its current for the price.",False
"Pros:
1) Actually fun
2) Controls are easy to work with
3) Great game for young kids 
4) Easy to pick up but still requires skill (and luck)
5) Hilariously unpredictable mass player dynamics
6) All content can be unlocked in-game

Cons:
1) Hackers/Modders
2) No report system
3) No anti-hack system (Dev's watches twitch streams only at this point)

If the dev's actually get off their backsides and actually add report or anti-hack systems then this game could make more of an impact to everyone but as they don't really care at this point I see bad reviews like this one coming in hard and fast.",False
"it's fun, needs lots of QoL fixes and the problem with hackers needs to be resolved asap, but other than that it's an awesome game",True
It's fun! Enough fun for a BR-like game!,True
"What started out frustration with the server issues (what else is new?) turned into a pretty fun experience. However, now the game is starting to be riddled with hackers. At first, it wasn't too bad, just frustrating, but now I'm starting to see hackers far too often. I just got out of a game with 3 of them and pretty much sealed the deal for me. If I could refund the game I would.",False
"First of all, the game is cute. No one can deny that. I can't imagine how rage inducing it would be if it wasn't. I've had a few moments where I've gotten fairly upset at this game, but then I sit back and think ""I am literally a bean trying to navigate an obstacle course with other beans"". It's too funny to stay upset at. 

Secondly- I loved Wipeout when it was airing. This game reminds me so much of it that it kind of makes me nostalgic. Also it's everything the Wipeout game should have been, and then some. 

Thirdly it's been a really, really, really long time since there's been a game that so many of my friends have been willing to play together. This game has been really great for re-connecting with people I haven't talked to in a while. See someone on your friends list playing, shoot them a message about it. It makes a great conversation starter and it's a great game to just play a few rounds with old friends with.

Fourth, it's not a huge time commitment, which is great. You can start and stop playing whenever. 

Now for the complaints, which all things considered, aren't that big of a deal...
1- Bugs. Most new games have these. They've already fixed a LOT of them. The biggest issue I've had lately is with the party randomly kicking a member or multiple members when a match starts. The game will put part of the party into the match, but send part of the party back to the start screen. It's odd.
2- Hackers.  Again, to be expected. They do have a reporting system for them which is nice. 
3- Names. I understand that this is mainly meant to be a kid's game and people my age couldn't behave but it would be nice to have a name other than ""Fallguy 1234"". I think they're working on that though.
4- Party size. Would be cool to be able to have bigger parties if you wanted, but I know that would screw up the balance of the team games probably. Private lobbies would also be cool.",True
"I recommend it because it is fun, BUT PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT ALL OF THE CHEATERS! Impossible to win an episode. Like every game I played this morning someone was hacking and insta-winning each match...",True
this game is a lot of fun one of the best game i played probably the best indie game but the hackers ruins the game that's the only problem with this game this game is colorful it's so simple and it's fun with friends but if you don't have enough money i suggest you to wait a sale or if you don't mind to pay 20 dollars then buy it,True
NICE AND CUTE GAME,True
"Great fun game I've clocked in 40 Hours in it so far. But...

PRO's
-Unique Levels and interactive game modes
-Jump in the game with friends & family
-Cool Skins that can be obtained by getting in game currency from completing courses
-Steam Achievements are a nice bonus 

CON's
-Cheating Cheating and more Cheating.
-Slime Climb is a Toxic Course, people will intentionally prevent you from reaching the last half of the area.
-Long load times / Matchmaking.
-Sometimes the servers are overloaded to the point where you will be stuck in an infinate ""Looking for Players"" Load. 
-The most rare cosmetics are hard to obtain, encourages hackers to hack in order to get those rare cosmetics.
-Some daily resets for cosmetic items takes about 3+ Hours to obtain the currency to purchase that item. 
-The game is playable, but when its not, you have to rely on 3rd party sites or twitter to find out if Fall Guys is down or not.
-Some of the physics is buggy, Some of the time, your Character can withstand hits while in the same situation you'll get thrown across the map. 

Personal In depth review. Game lives up to its reputation but for how long? 
Great party game. Has everything that makes the game fun, win or lose its still a fun experience. I laugh quite a bit at the things I've seen within my 40 hours of game play. And I still find certain things / situations funny. A game that puts a smile on my face whenever I play. 

However the Cons of the game sometimes turns that smile into disapointment. Hackers, Hackers and more Hackers. At least 1 out of 10 matches you play ""AT LEAST"" you'll run into a hacker. 

How to tell if someone is hacking? 
The top half of a ""Fall Guy Character"" wobbles erratically, their jump is 2-3 times higher than normal, Or when a ""Fall Guy"" Some how has a insane speed while absorbing any hits from an incoming projectile without falling over. Another thing I noticed is when you play Roll Out. You'll bump into characters. But there will be situations where you'll bump into someone and the reaction is unatural and irregular feeling which will make it obvious if someone is hacking. 

""Well maybe its how the game registers the action"" No not entirely, when you've clocked in 40 hours you'll know how the game reacts in situations in a genuine manor compared to someone who is hacking. No matter how many times a hacker tries to conceal it. you can tell if someone is hacking. 

 Some of the hacks can't be detected unless you yourself know how the course works. Like Tip Toe for example, its a course that requires a ton of trial and errors, sure there is some strategies behind the course. However hackers can detect which path to take automatically. They can figure out the pattern on the first try. This is what I mean when some of the hackers can't be detected.  If you see something odd about a person in Fall Guys you may want to keep an eye on them. If things don't seem right after the first two courses its likely they're hacking.

Mediatonic, has announced that they've taken care of the Cheating / Hacking. Which isn't true. If I were Mediatonic I would penalize the hackers, or make a dedicated servers so hackers are matched with other hackers. This is how you solve the problem. Have a detection or an anti-cheat and if someone is cheating, have the game boot them out of the server and make it so that steam account cannot play ""Fall Guys"" Its that simple. The game is currently ranked in the top 3 Steam Games, they have the capabilities to prevent cheating. Yet they choose not to. 

Game is great overall but the cheating needs to stop, Otherwise the game will slowly lose its luster. As I mentioned before I don't mind getting eliminated on a regular basis, its basically the point of the game. And I have a great time ""Winning or Losing"" its still a fun game. But the fact remains that the cheating needs to stop. 

I rate the game a 6.5 / 10  
If the cheating was gone as well as some minor tweaks and fixes with the servers,
 the game would for sure earns an 8/10 (But in its current state i'm giving it a 6.5 And for legitimate reasons listed above.",True

"I do recommend this game but I do want to make a suggestion if the dev team reads these reviews: while I appreciate the crowns provided by leveling up in the progression system. There needs to be a way to get crowns that does not hinge on winning consistently and isn't a maximum of 3. I feel the tone of this game is shoved to the side by an extreme desire to win and this has resulted in people hacking the game to try (and rather hilariously fail but regardless). I feel a good way to help alleviate at least one of these grievances with crowns is as follows:

Your performance in rounds leading up to the final round will count towards building up a crown of its own. If someone is consistently making it to the last round but failing they should at least feel like they earned progress towards that legendary skin they want. 

Of course winning should still provide more crowns than someone who keeps losing on the last round but it is frustrating as hell to know that making second place for the 5th time that day means you probably won't get a cosmetic that may be gone forever. 

To reiterate: I am not asking for crowns to become purchasable, I am asking that one can accrue crowns by getting close but not quite winning. The process could be as slow as the devs want to make it, but the current system where you only get a crown for winning and anything below gets zilch in terms of progress towards a cosmetic that needs crowns it should be different.",True

"Review update. Even after caving and getting this game just to play with friends, I still wouldn't recommend it unless they made it free-to-play or reduced the price heavily. If you are going to play this, play with other people or play expecting to spend hours grinding away with no expectations.

The biggest glaring issue for this game is still the idea that you're supposed to be trying to win, but most of the time it is decided for you rather than the other way around. Even if you practice these maps to perfection, too many things can go wrong which will snatch away a W.

Let's start with the physics. Control loss is incredibly easy to attain in this game that you have to be careful not to touch any barrier including other people. The server's way of processing everyone in one place is very sketchy and requires you to place yourself in a way where you cannot get shoved away from your goal, doing stuff like jumping over the crowd for example. 
This is also bugged in at least one way: on the block sliding map, it's possible to get stuck on one of the jumping barriers and never be able to recover in time because your character is constantly getting pushed while trying to stand up at the same time. I believe this also affects jumping where you can have a microsecond of control loss while running full speed and a jump input gets eaten. This has ruined a good number of games for me.

Hackers aren't in every game like the discussions are making it out to be, but they definitely do exist. They're not even shy about it either -- there's people that will zoom all over the place. You would think in this game's current lifetime there would be some diagnostics in place to locate them immediately. Perhaps it actually is being worked on at this moment, but not holding my breath.

Now let's talk about the maps:

Seesaws - If you fall behind enough you may as well just quit out and requeue. Even if you properly read which platforms you can jump between, you can land wrong and slide off. You can have other players that either don't want or don't know how to stabilize the platform and just pile on. This is easily the worst of the beginning stages and should be reworked.

Spinning discs & pendulums - pretty well balanced. nothing particularly special about it but it's a good first round map.

Spinning sticks & conveyor belts - well balanced. fan blades are a little annoying, but they can be dealt with or walked around. This one I like because of the ability to skip certain parts with the right jumps or getting knocked forward at the right moment. 

Memory - boring. cheap way of getting people to fall off from weird bumping physics.

Rotating cylinder platforms - not a hard one to win on. kind of weird since it feels like you're supposed to try to harass people in but since physics aren't consistent it's better to just hold out for as long as the round lasts.

Jinxed - you may as well just flip a coin on this one unless you're a dodge god with field of view maxed out ridiculously.

Sliding blocks - the only times I've gotten eliminated on this were when my character gets stuck on the jumping platform due to some glitch. Impossible to recover from once you're caught and the lamest way of getting eliminated. Possible to get caught in the traffic jam in the final push, but easy to avoid being caught in that trap. 

Eggs - pretty balanced, especially with the golden eggs providing a decent enough distraction. it's also possible to sometimes point where an egg flies which makes it fun challenge to steal from others.

Hoarders - also balanced. this one is fun being able to help out the other teams steal and then possibly try to yoink it away

Jump Club - love this one. occasionally frustrating with the spinning rods being closed off or people pushing but it's spacious enough to work with.  

Ball Race - probably my favorite team game. being able to block other teams is nice, but that doesn't happen if you are able to control the initial push smoothly

Slime Climb - a hard one to learn, but easy to get through once figured out. Problematic when you are in a crowd of people and can get shifted in the worst possible direction. Lots of people like trying to bully on this one but that's how you should be playing if you want to win.

Fruit Chute - RNG infested & lame. This is very similar to the seesaws where enough unlucky bumps is auto-lose. Would like to see this improved upon where a riskier path is more rewarding such as the middle going slightly faster.

Tip Toe - kinda scary to be on that narrow path with a cluster of people, but I think this one is fair. If you're not risking falling off at the front then you can get shut out when people find the solution at the end. 

Fall Ball - this is where you can see the problem with team games the most. This is usually so late in the game where there's few people so every person matters. Most of the time whoever wins the first goal wins the game because it's very clear one side has more decent players. This one I'll just quit out of if things are going disastrously because there's no point in wasting that much time or energy.

Fall (RNG) Mountain - the speedhacker's favorite and where this game's physics ruin it. Even jumping and landing wrong causes your character to tumble over for just long enough to get crushed. May as well just have a spinning wheel that points at the winner. 

Hexagons - In spite of it being absurdly difficult to remain in this one, it is still a better final stage than some of the others. My only problem with this one is the bug where you can land between closed platforms and still fall through. 

Jump Finals - probably the simplest and easiest one to win with. Only problem with this one is the jump input getting eaten randomly. Ironically the most interesting one of all of them.

Anything tail-related - delete. I don't know what the netcode or server hardware looks like, but the grabbing mechanics alone are too discrepant to make these remotely enjoyable. I've had cases where I've grabbed a person with a tail and it would not transfer well after their immunity should have worn off. Naturally because of server delay, I should expect to be grabbed from further away but getting held down and then grabbed immediately again should not be a thing. Personally, I wait now to the last 20 seconds because those are the only ones that matter. 

I'd really like to get the 5 wins in a row achievement, but that seems only attainable at this point if you are a hacker or incredibly lucky. (1 in millions)

--- old review below --

If you can get past this game being repetitive and losing or winning being more luck based, then go for it. 

This game has a lot of positive pieces holding it up, but unfortunately it has an equal amount of issues that don't become noticeable until you start playing it. 

Obviously it is graphically polished, and the MxC / Wipeout / obstacle course form of elimination through multiple rounds can be fun. From the looks of it, the server netcode seems to be mostly up to snuff as well; you can see that the delay creates a mess (people grabbing your tail from 2 feet away) but that's naturally going to come with online. 

The paradoxical idea of it being a party game and competitive is where it starts to fall apart. The idea of a multiplayer progression system to force people to stay invested is pretty bad. The achievement for winning 5 games in a row is very ludicrous considering what you need to be able to accomplish such a feat. Some of the game matches you can lose just by being unlucky with your character being pushed the wrong way, wacky physics barring you from the finish line, or teammates who  are grossly underperforming. The game wants you to try to win, except when you do then it turns around and throws hurdles that shouldn't even be there. And for $20, no less. There are plenty of other games out there you can spend that on and feel less shafted.",False

"This is a great game for many reasons, let's start with the lore. I'll try not to go into detail
1. Lore
After the obesity epidemic of 2086, most humans were of no use to their AI overlords. 
Instead, the AIFG decided that it would be best to genetically modify the remaining humans into what we see in the game. We'll call them the after-people, for it would be inaccurate to call them human.
They cannot hear, they cannot speak, they cannot smell (which may be a blessing, for the stench is unbearable), Their skin replaced, their eyes, reduced to black ovals, which barely work. Forced to wear shameful costumes, all in the name of entertainment.
The AI overlords toyed with them for their sick pleasure. Now forced to navigate obstacle courses, the after-humans are without hope. The slime consumes all.
You play as a subject, and to win, is freedom.

2. Gameplay
You navigate obstacle courses with an objective given to you.

3. Music
It consists of the screams and cries of the after-people. Pretty cool.

4. Visuals
The visuals are as sickening and disturbing as the story is. Very immersive.

"Not recommended... yet
It's okay, but it needs a lot of work...

Team modes are straight garbage, where overtime screws over the winning team and there's absolutely no rhyme or reason for what happens. Beyond that, with no communication, teams end up either being frustratingly bad, or insanely good.

Latency needs work, the tail games really suffer from this.

Really, servers in general need a metric ton of work, but that's maybe understandable considering how big it has been. The game is borderline unplayable and you do not get credit if you log out. It is a disaster.

There is a little bit of a lack of content at the moment, but it seems like more games are on the way (hopefully)

Half of the content is great, the platforming segments are extremely entertaining, and there is hope for more content soon. I hope over time they will fix the main issues with the game. If they can fix some of the more glaring issues and find a way to make team competitions more enjoyable, then this would definitely be a recommended game.",False

"This is literally TF2 Deathrun/WarioWare the videogame... and I love it.

Jokes aside, it's very clearly that the game has taken inspiration from many Deathrun and WarioWare mods from CSS, TF2, Gmod, etc. but it's original enough in it's presentation that it really stands out as its own game. Especially with 60 players, the game is ever so intense but also hilarious.
However, the game still needs polish and changes to be the best.

PROS:
-Matchmaking is pretty quick for a 60 player game
-Addicting as fuck, spending an hour feels like just minutes
-Physics is wacky but fun, makes for a lot of moments like grabbing people and throwing them off ledges, Lion King style
-Cosmetics are adorable af
-Currency is very easy to earn and there's huge bulks of them for cheap (though tbh DLC packs have the best ones)
-$20 game so the microtransactions aren't entirely BS
-Lots of quick on-the-fly puzzle solving/decision making.

CONS:
-Controls need some more polish. Getting stunned for diving isn't fun and makes the feature almost useless
-Team matches SUCK and easily get you to lose. The Eggs gamemode is straightup broken
-Many maps have similar gamemodes
-Fortnite-style stores are overrated, this one has a shorter rotation but it's very irritating to wait to buy a skin

"Super fun game....BUT!

The servers have been total garbage since release and the devs somehow can't figure out how to fix this? This makes a lot of games total crap. 

People grab you when they're NOWHERE near you, some physics (like balls) don't respond correctly to your character. Hoopsie Daisy rings get snatched away from you by the person who's behind you and jumps through them afterwards. When multiple players are piling on top of each other you get KO'd by their hitboxes slamming your face in. The list goes on...Not to mention that they can't even fix a simple name glitch after all this time....

It's understandable that many people are frustrated that the servers are taking a while to get back up, but please know that the devs are still working to get the servers up to speed. It's launch day, so stuff like this is expected.

But regardless. I've had a lot of fun playing Fall Guys. It's pure chaotic fun. The minigames are great, and qualifying for each round gives a satisfaction that just isn't there in other BR's.

"Nice game, little bit buggy at first but it should be fixed soon. Noice",True
"I decided on a complete and utter rewrite now that the server issues are gone. Do note that my actual recommendation is the same, I am just altering the fluff.

I still stand by my original statement that this game seems like a mobile game that you would play while chilling on the toilet, waiting for the inevitable. You play it for five or ten minutes and then put it down. Not necessarily a bad thing, honestly, but not exactly a good thing, either. I feel like the more you play this game – the more hours and time you sink into it, the less fun it becomes. It becomes less fun at an alarming rate. This could be subjective, it really could, but I have no idea. This ‘fun meter’ resets after a period of time, of course, hence why I somewhat, loosely, compared it to a mobile game.

Moving on as I am tired of speaking about toilets and bathroom habits.

The team-based modes are a detriment to the game. I am sure they are fun if you are in a squad of friends and like-minded individuals, but when you are solo and your win relies on other players using their brain, you can expect the same results as you would from any other multiplayer game. Losing after clutching the last round because someone decided to go AFK, just stand around, or actively grief the game by hitting the soccer ball into your own net (happens every time I get that mode) is not a fun or inviting experience. I would love to see them be able to be voted to be skipped, honestly. If the majority want to skip them, they are skipped.

Anyway, riding off that soccer game, ping is a hidden annoyance that rarely appears but when it does, it is annoying. It may still be slight server issues, but seeing the soccer ball fly across the map, flying through players, and scoring before it snaps back is anger-inducing. Not only that but getting grabbed from over a meter and a half away, hitting the soccer ball and having it move an inch because you are not where you think you are or the soccer ball is not where you think it is will forever make me grind my teeth.

The game is cute, quirky, pretty unique, and causes time to fly by when you are having fun. If you play too long, you risk the game becoming boring and frustrating, like all games, I dare assume.

Either way, I rate this game a solid eight. I do recommend playing it and a game takes about ten or so minutes, so refunding it if you dislike it is not too harsh. Two or three games and you have essentially experienced the game. Each run takes about ten minutes, so plenty of time.",True
fun n cute :),True
The Chad of the battle royale games. Really fun.,True
"Ok, game is super fun but the map should be way bigger than that with more elements and if we could create our own maps, that would help even more the game.

Now for the currency its expensive and very slow to get something worth it. Like that CE edition was a waste of money, don't bother tbh.

Lets's see how it goes first month.Hope we get more mechanics along the way because so far something is missing and it can get boring fast after hours of play!

"I have played 4 hours of the beta, and around 12 hours of watching streamers, if that means anything. Yes there are connection issues, but I'm sure that will be fixed soon, so it isn't much of a problem. The game has tons of potential, but in its current state I find it very hard to play.

Positive:
- Good music
- Unique character customization
- Fun, lots of nail-biting moments and hilarious physics popoffs
- Interesting physics system, everyone is near the same playing field
- The developers have discord channels, giving their users a chance to give suggestions

Negative:
- Barely anything has changed since the beta. They didn't listen to any of the streamers' problems with the game.
- Gigantic price tag of $20, which you can easily experience everything the game has to offer within an hour of playing. DLC content is already available at launch to exploit players who bought into the hype train, proving the developers are extremely money-hungry. I would expect to have most, if not all, content when I have already payed money. It might as well be a free game if you sell cosmetics and coins.
- Most of the levels have very poor design, and are very unbalanced. For example, the fake door level. Everyone piles up at one door, and you are likely to get pushed to the bottom and have a pretty high chance of not making it after you are stun-locked for around 5 seconds. I understand the game is supposed to be chaotic, but being put at last place because of RNG completely takes away the fun.
- The grab mechanic is way too powerful, especially for low ping players. You can be grabbed from extremely far away. While on decent ping, you can be right next to them and not latch on. It is especially hard for streamers (or anyone who gets teamed on) to play against grabs, it can completely ruin a good run.
- Team games are unfair. You can do very well, but still lose. It's RNG, ruins fun.
- All of the final games are unfair, besides the tnt run hexagon thing. You can spawn behind players and never be able to catch up to them.
- The queue system is horrible. It can take around 2 minutes to fill a lobby, which shouldn't happen when there are 75000 players online.
- Tons of infinite loading screens and bugs. It should still be in beta for how small the game is and how many bugs there are.

And a few nitpicks:
- Unless they changed this already. There is no way to change settings or quit out of an active game while alive. It is extremely frustrating having to alt f4 just because you got flung all the way back to the start and want to start a new game.
- Loading the next level takes way too long, it should be loading the next stage while the long elimination screen happens. I pretty much alt-tab every time a level finishes to do something else because it takes too long.
- It has a seasonal battle pass system.
- Disabling the music volume also removes a lot of sound effects.

And the cherry on top (nothing against the game itself): I watched their discord for a bit with a message logger plugin. The moderators delete a lot of criticism and/or slightly negative comments because they want to keep a ""wholesome and positive vibe."" When the developers respond to messages, 80% of the time they have a very arrogant attitude, completely shaming their players for asking simple questions or having criticism.


My main problem with the game is how heavily they monetize it. Could be a great game if they listened to criticism. I would not recommend buying this for multiple people to play together, giant waste of money. Only buy if you have money to waste and want to have some fun every once in a while.",False

"Holy crap, this game is amazing. It's a lot better if you play it with friends, but even solo it's great. 

Starting off it's very weird, but keeps being funny. It used to remind me of this old show called Takeshi's Castle that they used to broadcast on the TV, as well as Ultimate Wipeout, mixed in one. For the nostalgia of that alone I love that this game. 

Of course, some obstacles are frustrating, and being stuck in the horde of other players is annoying, but as you play you discover more small tactics and tidbits that allow you to gain an edge on the others. Sometimes you'll luck out and even those moments are amazingly satisfying. 

The customization of your costume is also very funny, and getting more is easily achieved by simply playing the game. The options you purchase with crowns are great, as well as the ones with Kudos, because both are earnt simply by playing - no microtransactions. Crowns are harder to get, admittedly, but winning isn't impossible. It requires a bit of luck, a bit of skill, and a lot of persistence. 

Earning anything in this game feels like you've worked for it, and not even with tonnes of grinding; Making it accessible and rewarding. And again, there's no pay-to-win. You just play, and you just hope to win, and you can get anything you want. Rewards are switched out once a day, so there's always something new, and with a just 2-ish hours, if you're lucky, you can easily get enough Kudos to buy all Kudo-bought items in the store. 

TL;DR: No microtransactions, good game remeniscent of Takeshi's Castle and Wipeout, easily achievable rewards, funny moments of luck, no high skill-cap but applying some know-how gives  you an edge, very rewarding, and not overly long matches. You can also go right back into a new game when you fail.

5/5 stars.",True
"tl;dr They're not going to fix this game before it dies. Don't waste your time on it.

Hackers galore (EAC isn't going to fix that by the way), sh!t servers that will either kick you or take your rewards even if you do manage to make it to the end. Discord server is a fukcing joke, they tell you if you're having server issues to try a VPN. Spend $20 on a non functioning game and then a VPN service monthly in order to even attempt to play it. Complete waste of time and money.

After over a month of playing and the issues only getting worse, I feel confident to post this now without the need to change it. This game is never going to survive in the state it's in, and by the time devs actually push an update to fix things, nobody is going to give a damn anymore. Good job, you ruined what could've actually been a decently fun party game.",False

Other than that, game is having the same launch day issues as basically every game; Servers are going up in flames because like every company, they under-estimate their crowd size (Because server's aren't cheap).

"The game idea is great, but the execution is horrible. My so far experiance is that the game is still WAY too buggy. Often with team games such as ""soccer"" the ball either doesnt move or the ball just gets launched to space in a wrong direction, it rarely ever works properly for me. Then another example is the end mini game ""Hexagone"". Here i just fall down straight trough the platforms wile they havent even bin stept on, pretty much losing instantly and leaving my hard work of getting to the end game utterly useless.

If fixed, this game will be great. But currently it is just infuriating having to watch myself lose over and over due to the game being either buggy or people having high latency and lagging around, making it nearly impossible to catch them in games like ""tail tag"" or ""don't get jinxed""",False
"[i]Fall Guys[/i] is a ton of fun, especially when played with friends and a little bit of alcohol. If you've seen the game shows [i]Takeshi's Castle[/i] (rebranded as [i]MxC[/i] in most of the Anglosphere) or [i]Wipeout[/i], it's basically that but in video game form. It's such a simple concept for a video game and yet it has nearly endless potential. In retrospect, it's surprising that it has taken so long for someone to make a game like this.

[i]Fall Guys[/i] executes on the concept really well, but not perfectly. I agree with almost all of the criticisms in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/WitchTaunter/recommended/1097150/]WitchTaunter's review[/url]. Specifically:

[list]
[*] They need to add more mini-games. It would also be cool if they could add some procedural generation to the existing race courses so they're not the same every time.

[*] When playing solo, team games are frustrating as there's no way to communicate or strategize, not even via short pre-written messages. This makes your success or failure seem almost completely out of your control. This is less of an issue if you're playing with friends since you can at least communicate and work together.

[*] Perfect Match, where you're supposed to have to memorize the fruits that appear on tiles below you, is totally broken because you can always just go where the crowd goes.

[*] I hate Royal Fumble and Team Tail Tag. In both of these games the objective is to get a tail and hang onto it until the game ends. It doesn't matter how long you hold the tail for, only that you have it when the game ends. This makes the first half to three quarters of the mini-game feel pointless. [i]Fall Guys[/i] generally handles lag pretty well, but in Royal Fumble and Team Tail Tag it's a huge issue as your tail can sometimes be stolen by someone who appears to be a full body length away, and at other times you'll grab someone who has a tail and mysteriously just not get it.

[*] There are already cheaters in the game. This isn't really the devs' fault as cheating is almost unavoidable in PC games, and it's really pathetic that people feel the need to cheat at a game like this which should be a fun casual experience. But be warned that it's already happening and I'm not optimistic that it will be stopped any time soon.

[*] There's a weird visual distortion on some moving objects. It's almost as if motion blur is being applied, even though I turned it off in the menu, or perhaps as if some objects are vibrating slightly. It's usually only noticeable on more distant objects and when spectating, so it doesn't impact gameplay, but it can be a bit distracting.

[*] No 21:9 support. I know 21:9 monitors are pretty niche, but it's 2020 and it's not hard to support 21:9 in most modern game engines. Pls bro.
[/list]

These issues can be frustrating sometimes, but overall the game is still a blast to play. I'm optimistic that more mini-games will be added in the future, and I think that alone will be a huge improvement since it will make the game less repetitive and make it less common to have to play a mini-game you don't like. $20 is a great price for a game that already promises dozens of hours of fun in its current state, and if the developers continue to add new content, which it seems like they will, that could turn into hundreds of hours.",True

FUN,True
They found a way to concentrate pure joy into a physical form and I couldnt be happier,True
"Team games ruin it. Also there are two luck based games (door dash and the disappearing tile one). There are also hackers after only two days. There is no almost no variety at all (you will always play see-saw once per game). Right now you're not paying for the game, you're paying for the idea of the game (a parkour battle royale).Yeah this game a cutesy art style, but that really doesn't excuse game design THIS BAD. Seriously though this game needs serious updating and quality of life improvements if people are going to keep playing this.

2) Fix the hacking and improve the servers

3) Make more games like Slime Climb which reward the player for being skilled.[/h1]

"Man after 20 hours I really have learnt alot. Let's go over some of the issues I have with the game.

I bought the game roughly 2 weeks after release, and despite the few amount of hackers I stumbled upon, I had a ton of fun. Everybody was sorta-new and had no idea what they were doing -- which is great! I really enjoyed this phase.

However, as more and more people learnt how to manip this game and that being a bad player = win, it started to descend into a really repetitive circle. Start off getting bumped, roll a dice on a team game, lose the ending due to rng or awful plays. It's what I've gathered so far and I cant even spew 30+ minutes in one session anymore without tabbing out or closing the game.

My main issues with the game are:
- How bad the collision is. You LITERALLY GET PUNISHED for jumping, for running, for playing the game. Either other people are using non-collision cheats or my character is as wonky as a fla‎‎c‎‎‎‎‎‎cid‎‎‎‎ wee‎‎‎‎w‎‎‎‎ee, because people can bump me and get REWARDED for it, but if I do it back, my character falls OVER and within seconds I'm at the back of the pack. WTF??

- Grabbing. I'm pretty sure this is an unfinished mechanic, but CONTROLLER PLAYERS have  more range and more consistency grabbing stuff than K+B players? While it's not 100% consistent, you literally lose every tail grab because of this. Either your teammates will choke and not get a single tail for your team, or you'll get grabbed across the map on an elimination one. I havent seen much of an issue with normal grabbing but I hugely dislike how you get stunned just because someone clicks on you. So stupid.

- The maps. Seesaw is the biggest curse of the entire set; if the first map is seesaw, I quit out and requeue. There's no point fitting 60 people in a map that's supposed to be competitive and cooperative. People will rush to the end and fail trying, which therefore weighs everybody behind them down. You literally cant win unless you're at the front of the pack. Free win if you do, woo. 
Other maps I have an issue with is: Hit Parade, Hoarders, Door Dash, Tail Tag, Royal Fumble. 

- Braindead players. People will blindly run into you and not get knocked or punished, but if you do it, you get sent flying into the abyss??? What kind of game design is that. I wanna play the game, not worry about some jack‎‎as‎‎‎‎s screwing over my movement. It's not even the hackers that ruin the game anymore, the biggest issue is the people with no game sense or respect for others. Ruins the game for everyone including themselves.

I really hope season 2 breathes new life into the game with bigger maps and less-punishing player collision, the game is still fun in small quantities with friends but overall I cannot say it's worth 20 bucks right now. It was good on release, but the playerbase has dissolved into a mentality that being braindead gives you free win passes -- and it's true. And like other reviews have stated, the game is awfully repetitive especially with the current playerbase.",False

"There's at least one cheater in almost every round, and sometimes you can't even spot them until the final game, leaving you with no chance of winning. The latency issues can also make this game quite unfun.

If the cheaters were gone and the devs improved their servers, maybe things would look different, but until that changes, I do not recommend buying this game.",False
fix the speed hacking,False
"Fun? Yes. Overrated and overhyped? Absolutely.

The lack on content makes this game go stale rather quickly, and while what content that's there is good, it's not enough to warrant the attention and hype that it's gotten since it's launch. There is certainly fun to be had, especially with friends, and it's a nice game to turn your brain off and play while watching or listening to something else, but it ends up feeling like a chore to play after losing multiple rounds in a row to some complete random bs, whether it be the janky physics or other players that dedicate themselves to ruining the game for everyone else by blocking other players. It's too easy to get mad at this game, and I don't think you'd be missing much by not jumping on this hype train.

"I feel like this is not for me, but I also just think it kinda sucks too. Who knows. Casual does not mean janky physics and rng games. Maybe I'm just too competitive.

Tried to play and servers are unavailable since the release day. You'll only get loading screens and errors. But hey! The in-game shop works, that's where the focus is. (:

Additionally there are unfixed bugs such as football minigames clipping through players, jittering and having 10 fps alone. Mouse cursor randomly appears when in ""play mode"" and will never disappear until you restart the game. You are also randomly returned or propelled in any direction when many players collect at the same spot.

This is ridiculously unfinished game and it shows. The release should've been postponed for multiple weeks or months to fix these issues. It's obscene that you'll release the game only to take the servers down for 23h of the day. Do not buy anything from this developer.",False

Honestly the game is very fun, it's lacking a little variety but it's not super difficult once you get used to the controls and strange physics. More content is on the way so that's good.",True

"After nearly thirty hours of running, jumping, tripping and pure shenanigans, I definitely can say I want, and will recommend this game. This is nothing short of pure, wholesome and giddy fun from start to end. While there is room to be 'try hard' in the game (I mean it's still a battle royal at the end of the day) it's not ment to be taken seriously. You will trip, you will bonk your head, you'll fall of see saws, get balls in your face, crushed by fruit and shoved off platforms. All the while they all sound like they are having fun with a cute kind of 'oooh woo woo' sound. You can also hug people!

Though of course gotta be critical as well. I've heard a lot of flack about team games and... I can sort of understand it. Some games feel pretty okay and fine, others feel a bit... jank. The worst one in my personal opinion is jinxed. It's basically team zombie tag. First team to be entirely jinxed is eliminated, and it happens on round two, and it's a two team game. Meaning half the team is gonna be eliminated on the spot and, while sure the game can balance itself out, the more jinx'd members one team has, the more fire power they have to eliminate the other team, it feels like a complete throw of the dice. With other games there is at least a kind of strategy too it all, and people can effectively coordinate themselves into rolls. That's my own opinion though.

If you wanna see more game play of it, I stream it every now and again. It's a battle royal I can actually excel in so I'm going to be gunning for it. See you all falling along with me. https://www.twitch.tv/moonlightsoldier",True

It's simple, mindless fun. It doesn't require much in the way of commitment from the player and the game doesn't ask for a lot in return; just run and time your jumps right. It's so lighthearted and easygoing that the competitive aspect of the game isn't rage inducing if you lose.

a game what really needed in 2020 <3 thx,True
The first hour is fun and attention grabbing as there is no other game around exactly like this. Into my second hour I became bored as the game is very basic and you quickly start seeing the same levels over and over again. I had a few laughs but the novelty wore off quickly and I had seen all that the game had to offer. More content will come and hopefully it will go free to play because apart from the cute graphics and quirkiness there isn't enough here to warrant the price tag. Worth trying out for a bit of fun. The game gets repetitive very quickly and I think player numbers will plummet after the first week unless the developer adds more content soon. I have asked for a refund.,False
Repetitive and full of hackers,False
"An amazingly fun game. All the negative reviews are from the day one launch issues due to an influx of players, So far played around 6 rounds, won one, formed a human pile with 3 of my friends and stole a tail in the last 2 seconds of a round for victory.

A great game over all, and hopefully will get even more content as time goes on

EDIT: The game continues to be great! Still playing it with my friend group, my boyfriend is especially good at it, and we hope to complete the season before its up (Which will be a first for me in any BR game)

This allows them not only to win races but I've seen this hack used to boost to the wall and fly up in the air during the FFA tail matches so they're glitching and will float always float in the air and rendering them untouchable.

Now I might only seen one hack, but this is just the tip of an iceberg. If the dev doesn't take this seriously, this game will be just a 2 months wonder when everyone just gets bored of the stages and fed up dealing with the hackers.",False

The game is developed and managed by Mediatonic, an independent game developer. Because of that, the servers of Fall Guys may not run at smooth as those of major game developers. Besides, it seems to have hacker issues. Nevertheless, it's still a fun multiplayer game to play after all. I believe Mediatonic is trying their best tackling the hacker issues.",True

I cannot recommend this game to anyone at this point. (Server is getting worse everyday)

It's a yes but also no, the lags and delay killed the game. Could be the match making issue.

By measuring a person as a bean, a person can grab another person 1-2 bean away or a few seconds after it happened because of bad synchronize network. It might not be everyone but can be anyone. It's just bad that you can be grabbed without being touched.

- Only 4 player parties when I feel like this is the game I want to play when I have like 10 friends on
- Takes a bit to get 4 ppl in a game with the server troubles sometimes
- Sometimes you can leave the game after you lose and have to either alt F4 or wait for someone to be crowned

That's what this game is, a ride, every single time, a ride.

When partying up with a friend, we are sometimes put into a different game/server. Not sure why that is occurring. Lots of disconnection problems. Can't leave the game despite spamming my esc button. Needs a lot of bug fixes.

I don't understand why they insist on using anonymous player names - on PS4 you see the actual PSN gamertag. If we could see the steam name, it would be possible to report people. 

The sad thing is some of the anti-cheat tactics should be so [b]simple[/b] for the developer to implement.

Headbutting the soccer ball sometimes barely makes enough contact to move the ball, while headbutting the volleyball in Hoarders sends the ball flying. The ring game is very RNG, and if you just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, well, no rings for you. And there are many times where desync will cause another player to snag the ring before you, even if you passed through the ring first.

The tail game can't make up its mind when grabbing a player's tail. Sometimes you grab the tail, sometimes you give the player a hug from behind. Sometimes other players will grab your tail from twice their arm length away. Most times you find yourself sitting around until the last 12 seconds to grab a tail. And when you lose your tail to another player, your character's legs sometimes give out, giving the opponent a chance to get away and you get to roll around aimlessly until your guy gets back up.

Landing from a slightly high jump, or just slight collision with walls, will sometimes makes your character's leg give out, and if that happens near anything moving, such as a player or a moving obstacle, enjoy rolling on the ground continuously until you're no longer making contact with that player or object. You will stay on the ground, flopping like a fish until you're free from contact.

Skins look cool.

Hex-A-Gone is the only good final round game as it is the only final game that is 100% skill-based. The newest final round game that was added, with the rotating arms and floors that drop out, is poorly designed. Pieces of the floor randomly drop out permanently, and they'll shake for about 4 seconds before they drop. But you could get super unlucky and end up on an island piece that is bound to drop out, but you have no idea that's going to happen until it's too late due to RNG. At that point you know you're eliminated - might as well quit to lobby and re-queue.

I had a game of Door Dash where I walked into the doorway with the mob of players then somehow got launched maybe 20 feet into the air before the last big drop. Did not qualify when I came back down.

Wouldn't recommend this game right now. Once there are more maps, then maybe. And maybe if RNG could be done away with, and if physics could be improved. I gave it a good chance, won about 10 crowns, but it's just not keeping me interested. 

EDIT: One thing I completely forgot to mention. Who knows why the devs did this, but the team games can have uneven teams. I've had 13 remaining players going into soccer, splitting the teams up 6v7. I've also seen the 3-team ball rolling game have 6v6v7. It would be extremely easy to check the number of remaining players, and then attempt an even division of that number to determine if a team game should be selected next. But nope.",False

"The recent addition of random swinging hammers, wrecking balls, and spinning platforms into every gamemode has significantly reduced the enjoyability of this game. It is common game design knowledge that by introducing Luck as an element in your game, you directly lower the skill ceiling. It no longer matters how good you are, or how comfortable you feel with the movement. Intentionally inconvenient random obstacles have successfully completed their job of leveling the playing field... by essentially randomizing who gets to advance a round and who does not. Wins no longer feel earned, and more like a relief that the game is just over already. I absolutely adored this game before these changes, netcode aside. I could look past the server issues for a game that was absolutely stormed by players. But this? These changes nullified the hours I put in to learning routes, finding ways to coordinate with the random players on my team, and even the sense of victory for making it to the later rounds. At the end of the day, [b] I didn't pay $20 to roll dice. [/b] Bring back the skill ceiling, remove the absurd amounts of randomly spawned spinning hammers (ESPECIALLY on team games,) because now this may as well be a board game based entirely off the luck of the draw.",False

I had hopes I might like this game, but there's more than one reason making it unfun and frustrating.

Pros:
[list]
    [*] Wipe Out-like game everyone wanted.
    [*] Cute and eye-catching, not gonna lie.
    [*] Fun and unique (at least feels like this on the beginning).
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
    [*] Too little content for such price.
    [*] Losing is too unrewarding. No matter how much you close to the finish, the second place feels like last place, this is very frustrating.
    [*] Whole story with hackers, how much time it took (including devs asking do not post with footage anywhere) is ridiculous.
    [*] Certain levels allow users easily ruin experience for the others by simply standing on a way.
    [*] Some skins, like pineapple one, always shown pink, this hasn't been patched since release.
    [*] No couch/split-screen play.

"This is a fun game and has a great potential, but I feel like this is an Early Access game. Considering the current content, this should be a way cheaper game. I would refund it if I could, but I wanted to experience for more than 2h to make that decision. I can see many easy tweaks that would greatly improve the experience. I'll list some of  my concerns, even though I think most of these things are intentionally made like this because it's good for streamer's audience and consequently way less fun to the players.

- Too little map variety. I played for like 2h and know each map inside out. The maps are short and small overall, they could spent more time designing more maps instead of cosmetic crap.
- Useless maps. There are some maps like the fruit memory one (just go to the squares where everyone goes when the fruit is chosen, there's plenty of time for that) and the one with the rotating cylinders that are too easy and barely eliminate any players.
- Faster load between rounds. The matchmaking is already done here, it takes like 20s+ to load another stage, could be 5s easily.
- Team maps should be optional or a different mode entirely.
- The ""grab the tail"" maps are really boring. Everyone in my bubble agrees.
- When we lose a round, just take us to the menu already. You have to press a button to exit, then you still have to confirm it. And if the round finishes before u exit to the menu, u have to wait for the (long) load time between rounds and the next one to begin (even though ur not playing it) just to be ABLE to go back to the menu.

Sadly most of these won't change because it's streamer's popcorn.",False

"Developers and Steam are manipulating reviews; an objective, thorough, and very smart review by @iiLaBelleRose was moved out of sight from Steam players, because while marked positive, it talked about what's nice about the game, but also what it lacks. The review is informative and also written in multiple languages (English and Spanish). She got awards from many players, who liked her review a lot and found it helpful, and wanted to reward her efforts of writing it in so much detail. But as you can see, the review can only be found when you search for it…
What I want to add to her review is that I think that the game can get repetitive quickly and there is no real reason to continue playing it after reaching level 40. After playing the game for more than 40h, I mostly get bored playing it. 
Also, the achievement “infallible” is not funny… It is meant in a fun way to have an achievement that would be incredibly hard to get, but for me this approach makes no sense… It is just sad to see that you will probably never get that achievement, even if you are really good. Once I had 4 wins in a row, and I think it will get harder and harder every day to get 5 wins in a row, because the number of new players (not so good players) will get smaller soon.",True

"In the current state of the game (even though it has only been out for less than a week so far), I wouldn't pay $20 for this game. There are a ton of bugs going on right now and there seems to be new ones popping up everyday. 

Team games suck. Unbalanced (lots of 5 vs 6 kinda games) and often get matched with teammates who could be 5-year-olds. 

Constant disconnections and servers being down for maintenance (even though it's still the first week things should be better).

A bunch of the maps and game modes are poorly designed. The game could have so many better improvements. Just go to the Fall Guys reddit thread for the game to see all the cool things this game could have. 

There is only like what... 10 different maps? For making people pay $20 they should have way more than that to cycle through the rotation. The game is gonna get stale pretty soon.

The names better change back soon. There should be a way to report inappropriate names so that players with good names can still appreciate showing them off. It's also nice for being able to view your friends playing.

Too many additional things that are wrong with the game to write down. Get this game when it goes on a big sale.

"Feels better to play than it looks, makes fun with and without team mates. The way some game modes are designed is super clever. It's being updated really frequently to address the bigger issues, and the issues this game has are very minor at best. Shoutouts to the marketing, server- and community management team, that's how it's done. It's probably THE game to talk about when it comes to BR like games.

There are skins that you can only win by actually winning games and paired with the fun gameplay it's a really worthwile game to play while you're doing something else like listening to a podcast or chatting with your friends inbetween. Plus longterm motivation is given with the Season Pass, which you can't boost with money. The only thing you can buy money with is DLC skins or the purple ""Kudos"", which you can spend on the lower grade cosmetics.

To adress the hackers in this game: yes, after 30h of gameplay you've see them quite often, but it's gotten better I'd say. I immediately leave if someone is noticably hacking, but some wait until the finals. But in team games there is a possibility to make them fail the round and I mean you can also always just leave and search for a new game. The playerbase is still massive and there is no need to worry about leaving an existing match.

"This game is the saddest attempt at a cash grab.

They paid the top 200 Twitch streamers to promote this game for the day. And on top of the $20.00 entry, the game is slammed full of micro-transactions. Including a carbon copy of Fortnite's battlepass and store. The game play is lackluster and you just play the same 5 gamemodes over and over again. There is no variety and it's just not fun in it's current state. I doubt this game will receive any real updates that don't include new additions to their micro-transactions and cosmetics.

EDIT: This game is also filled to the brim with cheaters. You're able to literally use cheat engine to cheat everything in this game.

EDIT2: I just wanted to further say that ever since I got this game, I've never been able to get into a game solo. I HAVE to join other peoples lobbies in order to play at all. It just gets stuck on 'Looking for players...'

"The hype is unwarranted. Extremely simplistic game with a very low skill ceiling. Its knockout format and team based maps essentially make winning a coin flip. A fully priced title that also has microtransactions on launch put into question the developer's motives and doesn't bode well for the game's long term sustainability, as it's clear that their focus will be squeezing as much money out of the consumer as possible before they gear bored, instead of actually making a worthwhile title that holds up on its own right.

Game is streamer bait and will probably be dead within a couple of months when popular streamers eventually gravitate towards something else. As of right now, due to lack of content and the flaws in its game modes, I cannot honestly recommend this to other people. The best solution is to wait and see if it ends up surpassing expectations. I hope it does, but it seems like another cash grab.",False

",False
"It's fun, but gets repetitive very quick. There just isnt enough there to keep you coming back. $20 isnt a bad price whatsoever - the game runs great and my experience with it was for the most part bug free in the beta and final release. No network issues in my 10+ hours with the game (beta + final release) I feel like I got my fix in the beta as the only game I've seen that wasn't in the beta was the volleyball game. Most betas I've played of any multiplayer game were usually just a small portion of what a game has to offer. ie: 1 map, and 1 mode. Usually those end up changing drastically anyways by release. I just can't understand why the devs wouldn't do the same.

Theres also issues with certain mini games and balancing. For instance, if 11 people make it and the next game is soccer, then teams become 5 v 6. This happens for various team games.

The original trailer they debuted promised a different game. I'm not going to act like I know anything about developing games - but this just doesnt have enough variation in gameplay, game styles, mechanics. I don't think adding a ""randomizer"" is going to make it any more fun either. I wasn't looking for HARDCORE competition, this is a silly game meant to chill out and have fun with. But it just becomes stale.

 It's a shame really, was looking forward to owning and playing this one. It also makes me feel better about how I use my time - 2 years spent on this game for this outcome is pretty disappointing. I'm not a fan of immediate promises of updates on launch day, especially for features that truly should've been in the game from the get go. Those promises will be fulfilled when the game is dead. If it took 2 years to make this game, I can only imagine how long these content updates will take. If only they had twice the budget and dev team. Refunded until I see an extreme update in content.",False
"I find the game very fun to play, especially among family and friends where we can all laugh and have fun. The controls are simply that anyone can pick up the game. However, the big downsides that I find in this game are the occasional cheaters that pop out of nowhere along with server issues. The servers every now and then would kick me or my group members out  of the party, making it sometimes frustrating to continue. The cheating part is the big thing that would however always drive me away from this game. I hope this gets fixed otherwise it's really hard to say I recommend this game, as much as I want to.",False

Fantastic game that you can pick up and play for a few minutes or a few hours.,True
"Game is not EU friendly. The latency is atrocious, and i sit on a 100/60 up/down Mbit line, wired not wi-fi.
Tail tag/Jinxed = can't steal other peoples tails, they just clip right throu me OR i pin them in a corner and hold my grab on them until the little pop sound triggers (indication they break free of your grab) to see them run away with tail still attached AND people steal my tail from 10 meters away whenever i start with a tail.
Fall Ball and Hoarders = constandtly clipping throu the ball / almost no impact made on the ball despite jamming straight into it.
ANY game mode = if somebody runs into my fall guy, he keels over and flops around for a good 4 seconds and thats just if im lucky and the rest of  the incoming herd don't run me over.
If i try to tackle someone, my guy usually takes flight while the guy i 'trackled' just keeps tugging along without flinching.
The game was fun for the first 6'ish hours but after that it was on heavy decline, cause loosing to shitty server connection/delay is just not fun.

-Edit
Forgot to mention the constant ""Disconnected from server"", just before you hit the final round. It has happened enough times in  a row now, that i am starting to suspect it is triggered by a player in the round. Since the frequency of it happening **Just before the round starts** has increased ALOT (I just had 8 times in a row. Where i made it past 4th round and got disconnected) and it all picked up as a new 10 crown cost Android/Robot costume came in the 72hour limit shop.

"Something's wrong.

I am aware that this is just a first season and that developers (hopefully) are going to update the game in the future but if you're going to buy this game right now I do not recommend you to do that. The game itself is good as a concept but it's the small things that ruin the whole experience for me.  Starting with the littlest things like an unremovable cursor in certain moments, price of the game, and ending with much more serious problems like cheaters and toxicity (because of which the developers even had to remove nicknames). Also, it's a matter of days if not hours when a game becomes very repetitive and therefore boring.

"Weird recommendation, because I wholeheartedly recommend this game, but I have a ton of criticisms about it (some of which don't even directly relate to the game!). The main positive thing is that the fun stages are really fun. The janky physics are even (sometimes) fun. The streamlined BR experience is a huge plus. I'm sure anyone has either heard someone say or had that thought that ""Hey, this is MXC Royale!"" That feeling is great.

Negatives:

Basically all the team games suck. I enjoy the tail mini game, but that doesn't need to be a team game (and it's still fun in the non-team versions!).

Part of the reason team games suck is that it's a crapshoot if the teams will be imbalanced, if you'll be on the smaller team, if your team members know how to play, if your team members actually care about trying, etc. 

The ""memorize the fruit on the tile game!"" is pointless unless you don't pay any attention. It is fun if a bunch of people all flock to a tile and then fall off, but that almost never happens.

the OTHER fruit game is frustrating.

Fall Mountain isn't great. slime climb seems like, with tweaks, it could be a better final map? maybe not. 

The door game is frustrating, but it's supposed to be so I guess that's fine. Same with seesaws. 

It's not a review bomb if people are frustrated by bad servers and microtransactions.

I'm sure the servers will be reliable eventually. I haven't had issues, but I also haven't bothered to try as much because every time I think about playing I see ""SERVERS DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE SRY UwU""

The whole 'seasons' thing I'm pretty sure they got from Fortnight, wish they would just add new mini-games instead of moving to a whole new set.

After reporting several players and getting no confirmation that they even received my emails and tweets...I'm sorry but for me the game is going to die upon arrival by people simply being able to finish a map or just fly avoiding all traps and drops

--------------------------------------------------

Can you guys remember a time where you actually had fun playing a Battle Royale? Where you weren't just constantly stressed out looking behind your back hoping to god that somebody isn't trying to screw you over and end your entire run? I genuinely haven't, as with games like Fortnite, PUBG, you name it, I've probably played it and then stopped playing it shortly after just because of how unfun it turned out to be. Fall Guys is a game with personal enjoyment at the center, though at times this message gets contradicted, at the core you are in control and it doesn't really matter what happens in the game, you're just trying to stay alive.

The game can be divided into three types of games: Races, Party Games (similar to what you'd find in Mario Party), and Team-based Games.

[b] The Party games are easily the best of the bunch, [/b] the most fun, and you can spot them from a mile away. They're the ones with the fun gimmicks like, jump through the holes in the way, grab a tail, or memorize these shapes. These are easily the most enjoyable out of the entire game and I hope that the developers add a lot more of these into the game.

[b] The Races are usually pretty fun, [/b] I'd say that they are extremely good at weeding out the chaff from the group as at the game starts with 60 people participating, these races should be used to thin that number down. Only problem is that the final round can be a race, and races are completely luck based. You can go from 1st to 10th easily, and during the final round this CANNOT happen when you've done absolutely nothing wrong. It's just feel bad for no reason.

[b] The team games are awful, [/b] there's so many things wrong with them I honestly haven't a clue why they're in the game. Nobody likes them, unless you're with a squad, you dread the team games. Unreliable team members who can just throw the game despite you doing nothing wrong combined with the possibility that the teams can be uneven? Seriously how is this in the game? I played a game where it ended 15 - 0 all because we had one more person on our team than they did.
I honestly hope they don't develop any more team games or find some way to balance them, because they're honestly the worst part about the game. Maybe only put them in if majority of the lobby is in stacks?

There's also the issue of a lack of games on launch. Honestly, you can play this game for about an hour or so and see majority of the games that are available. This isn't too bad as it seems the developers are being responsive and working on updates, but it's something to keep in mind; there's just not too much to see.

If you've played Fortnite, you're very familiar with the cosmetic store, every so often a new set of cosmetics will go for sale and you can buy them with the In Game currencies you earn. There is absolutely no pay to win, and no currencies you can only get by paying either. As such the shop is very very fair and something I'd like to see more of in games.




Overall, very enjoyable game that while a little shallow and with some glaring issues, it can be expanded upon and fixed very easily with time. While that might seem like a risk to some, at $20, a huge active playerbase, and responsive devs, it's a very safe risk to take.",True

If you dont mind relying on majority of the time having a crappy team and losing if you get a team game, then ignore all this. But if that will annoy you then. That happens a lot.

"This game seemed like a fun game where you play challenging obstacle-courses for a chance to win the crown out of 60 people at first. However, after playing a couple of hours I must say, that the team games are absolutely ruining the game as it is.

For those who don't know: team games are sprinkled in the show and are stuff like ""5v5v5 whichever team has the least amount of eggs in their basket after 2 minutes gets eliminated"". These team games are not much more than a coinflip simulator. As a single player there's nothing you can do to influence the outcome and it all depends on if you have a couple of good teammates or not. After 8 hours of playing I get qualified in 90% of the single games, almost all eliminations before the finals are from team games. There is literally no way for me to improve right now and the only way for me to get crowns is by hoping to not get team games or winning the coinflip when I get them. Seriously, it would not change much (even may be better) if they just eliminated some people at random in between rounds.

"A 3D platformer battle royale! Very kid friendly.

I'm giving this a lukewarm recommendation. It's a lot of fun when it selects fun games, but a few of them are utterly boring. Most of the survival rounds are way way too easy and will put you to sleep. The final rounds would be way more exciting with fewer people left, and Fall Mountain is always an anticlimax because it's so short with so few hazards. Why not let whoever designed Slime Climb make a finale instead?

Another missed opportunity is on the postmatch screen where you see the eliminated players fall out of their little squares: why not show all the eliminated players and not just the ones who didn't leave the match? It would be a lot more satisfying!

I can see why they wouldn't want to have player names displayed to keep the game kid friendly, so why not have fun but innocuous custom name components as a cosmetic instead of just assigning you some stupid number? 

Also, there's no option to turn off camera follow.

Very fun game but a bit frustrating because there are so many obvious ways to improve it.",True
Fall guys is an extremely fun game that's great because its hard to take seriously. Its not very competetive and thats a good thing. I would recommend it to anyone who likes light-hearted video games.,True
guy,True
they fucked the game so hard with the fucking update,True
"It's an enjoyable game especially with friends to rage with BUT

1) There's a ton of hackers despite the devs proclaiming they get banned immediately after they hack once. This is unlikely considering some days I have a hacker every 4-5 games, sometimes two in one game. Also if you cheat in a game like this or honestly in games generally, you should seriously reconsider your life choices.
2) There's nowhere near enough maps to keep you entertained for prolonged periods of time unless you really fall in love with the game. However they're adding more maps next season which should renew my interest.
3) Bugs related to ragdoll mechanics. I can't even count how many times I got stuck to an object making me lose a game, how many times I fell and it took my guy 5 seconds to stand back up instead of the usual 1-2 seconds because the ragdoll bugged out. Mechanics that make you feel like you can't affect the outcome of a game feels really frustrating. 
Some people complain about team mini games and they do make me feel hopeless sometimes, when two people on my team go AFK or - due to lack of an ingame match making rating, you get to play with people who are obviously new to the game but that is to be expected in any team game so I wouldn't consider that a con.

Other than that it's lots of fun in small doses. Especially recommended to people who don't have time to play videogames and only play sporadically, that way you get the most bang for you buck as you won't get burnt out as easily as if you clocked in a lot of hours in a row.

Hackers ruin the game. They cheat every game and devs don't allow us to report them easily. The amount of cheaters in the game is ridiculous and there's no way to report the cheaters properly.

Have had hours of fun on this game! but sadly cannot recommend this game to new users as the state of the game with the amount of cheaters/hackers makes the game miserable. if you're going to play this game my advice would be to leave every lobby at the start if there is a cheater in your lobby just so you don't not ruin your own experience.

Fun game but isn't worth 20$,True
"Little fun game for some hours. Gets stale pretty fast. PR department of the game is pretty good. Since this is for some strange PR reason popular as hell. But it looks and plays like a game heavily scrapped together within 6 months due to the pandemic .. to make a huge buck out of bored people.

Since this is a Game as a Service. We all can expect far more content since there are currently only 24 (+1) maps. Some are fun .. some are frustratiing.. some are god like. Slime climb for example is just the best of them all. We need more maps that can actually dump people out. While stuff like tiptoe is just lame, boring and sometimes frustrating. Often enough you get team games that aren't fun in the slightest imho ( but I like all the ball games like fall ball and rocknroll ).

The reason why this is negative mainly is ... that I have a feeling that these devs lie to us in regards of cheaters. They act like they are working against them but I honestly believe that they do the opposite.

This version of the game is infested with cheaters while the devs say "" our in game systems detect cheaters the first time they cheat and ban them"".

Yes. Thats why we never heard of even one guy being banned. And keep seeing cheaters with skins you only could get if you have 10 crowns.

They also need ages for fixing real names. A game where you cant and shouldnt report cheaters .. but infested by them.

I don't like liars. Even in this scummy industry full of consequenceless scamming and lying.

They don't deserve a positive review unless I really see them make steps forwards against cheaters instead of 2 steps back and PR phrases only.

For people interested and reading this. I really recommend you waiting a few months until the devs showed that they really care about the game on PC and not just PR talk memes on twitter. ( I also have the feeling that this game has a timelimit in regards of community, it is fragile and can collapse at any point if they continue to deliver only minor patches and lies)

I will change it to positive once I see cheaters getting banned for real and when the game gets enough content that is actually fun and not frustrating or looks like a lazy reskin of a other map.. which kinda seems like a trend in this game. There are a lot of similar maps scrapped together but as long as they improve the overall map number. It's okay.",False

The only real way to get rid of them is to hope you're on their team for a team game and then purposely do everything you can to lose which when you're relying on your player base to do that rather than enjoying the game they've paid for is utterly embarrassing.

Not to mention the team based games are a complete joke... I can't tell you how many times I've qualified to the 3rd or 4th round, just to lose in some team based game because my team is filled with people who act as if they've never played a video game before. There should be some kind of tweaking in that regard. 

There should also be more maps and maybe even certain game modes you can select. I know for a fact I haven't played on all 20, but somehow in the 11 hours I've logged, I keep getting almost the same maps selection every time I play. 

At this point, for $20, the game gets boring way too quickly...coupled by the frustration of getting thrown off a map, knocked out because of a glitch or repeatedly playing the same maps over and over again.",False
This is a fun game with friends but completely laden with bugs and cheaters.  The game mechanics also are highly frustrating.

"The developers completely failed to make sure the game was playable, let alone fun.

Your character trips and falls at the slightest provocation, and it's quite common that a single incident of bad luck proves to be unrecoverable.

The unpredictability of team rounds just adds to the frustration. It is painfully obvious that this game has no polish at all. As examples, in the soccer match, the game has no problem starting with uneven teams, and the balls jump around unpredictably as the server attempts to resolve physics despite player latency. In the egg match, it's almost impossible to steal eggs from opposing teams' nests because the controls are so poor. Other levels have similar issues.

Despite constant setbacks, I have been able to make it to the final round somewhat consistently - yet in 11 hours of gameplay have never been able to win that final match. The chaos and bad luck factors are cranked to maximum because the game does not eliminate enough players for the final match generally, so the odds are already much slimmer than in previous rounds (roughly 33% elimination pre-final match, 90% elimination in final match). But also, the win conditions are not always clear. I cannot adequately describe how frustrating it is to win that final race, except that you didn't realize you needed to TOUCH the crown in order to win. Then to win the final race AGAIN some time later, AND to touch the crown having learned from your past mistake, but then you BOUNCE OFF because you didn't realize you needed to hold the GRAB BUTTON WHILE JUMPING FOR IT, and someone else wins yet again.

I can honestly say that every single one of the 25 included levels in this game is my least favorite level. I look forward to playing none of them. None are particularly well thought-out or enjoyable - each is just a  hodgepodge of obstacles put together at random.

This is without question the worst $20 I have ever spent.",False
"TLDR: This game has scummy microtransactions.

Looking at the trailer and screenshots of this game, it seemed wonderful and delightful.
€20 is kind of a steep price, for me at least, so I took a chance on it.
Devolver Digital, after all, are one of my favorite publishers.

I was wrong to do this and have refunded my purchase,

The game loop of this game centers directly around the Kudos/Crown store.
You play the game to get Kudos or Crowns to spend in the game's store.
This store is lifted directly from fortnite.
There are a handful of cosmetic options available for you to spend your currencies on, and they refresh every few hours.
This is designed to either make you grind the game for the currency needed to buy something you want before time expires on it, or to straight up buy the Kudos incase you either think you wont get enough in time through gameplay.
It directly targets users with impulse control and is predatory in nature.

You have to pay for additional colors for your character, which is absurd.
And, these color palettes and patterns (which you also have to buy separately) do not affect the look of costumes.
Yes, you need to not only buy costume cosmetics, but the color palettes that you purchase do not affect the color of the costume, so you will be sitting around waiting for the right color of your outfit, probably buying it several times because in-game there is no way to see what colors are available for each particular costume.

The argument for such a thing usually would be to support the devs, but here, we have a game which costs money.
This isn't fortnite, the min portion of fortnite is free.
You support the devs by buying the game.
Devolver isn't broke, they are successful, they can afford the money for servers no doubt.

The rate at which Kudos are earned can differ greatly depending on how well you do, but its safe to assume about 2-4k per hour.
This isn't much, especially for a game like this where playing an hour worth of the same maps over and over gets old quickly.

This also doesnt matter.
Because the devs would not add an option to buy Kudos if they didn't want you to buy them and balanced their game correctly to facilitate someone never wanting to buy them. There is a giant BUY KUDOS button on the store page.

Many other games continue to get support after launch without the presence of microtransactions, so I'm not entertaining that as a valid excuse either.

This alone is the reason I'm refunding the game, because I believe that the store is so integral to the game loop by design, that it will not be modified or removed.

With this, you've painted yourself with the same brush as Activision Blizzard, who added an identical system to the new Crash Team Racing game.

I would like to hear a justification from the devs or from the publisher about this.

That might seem like a good amount, however, in my opinion it is nowhere near enough to be worth 20 bucks.

From what I have experienced thus far, this game is worth much less strictly due to the fact it gets old quickly, and you quite often get the same levels over and over.

"It's not not fun but is it $20 fun? eeeehhhh

The controls consist of moving, jumping, diving, and grabbing, the last of which is not even reallly used that much so mostly running and jumping in some form. Gameplay consists of mini games that while all different all felt similar because, again, all you really do is run and jump. While its slightly comically to see everyone dive down a pit and fall all over each other, is it worth $20? To me, it's not.

Buy it, play it for an hour, see what you think. You'll experience most of the game by then. If you don't like it, refund it. Would be very interested to see if this goes free to play at some point or if it goes on sale.",False

"I wasn't planning on writing this review today, but was checking the store page for a friend and noticed something about all the reviews (new ones especially). Almost every single one is complaining about ""all the cheaters."" I'm going to be honest with you, I've played the game for nearly 40 hours and seen maybe 2 people running a script or hacked client. Perhaps I'm lucky, but based on mine and my friends' experiences, you're more likely to encounter cheating in TF2 than Fall Guys. I really enjoy this game, it's tons of goofy fun, a good way to detilt, and a good way to escape the negative aspects of today's world. I could list a number of things I love about this game, but most importantly it catches and retains your attention. You play with a friend and theres infinite possibilities and you don't get bored, and it doesn't feel grindy. As an impatient sort of player, the lack of the ""grind"" feeling is hugely important to me. I hate having to do simple, repetitive tasks to improve my stats, or to get to the fun part of a game. Fall Guys does an amazing job of keeping their game fresh, and not in a BS way where they ruin everything or add skins and call it a day. Recently they've added new variants of the maps, and I can't lie, I wish they'd either fixed the servers (you WILL experience issues regularly, but the consequences are not very severe) or added new modes. However, the new variants, especially with the ""big yeetus"" bring a lot of fun and originality to a game that was already hard to make stale and boring. I look forward to future updates, and will probably continue to play almost every day with the boys. 4/5.",True

"[b][i] Pros [/i]
+ Variety of fun levels
+ So much fun with friends
+ Great handling of cosmetic items and the in-game shop
+ Progression system is not a grind and can easily be completed.
+ No skill is required to play this game but winning does require some knowledge of the gameplay mechanics 
   and sometimes luck to be on your side

[b][i] Cons [/i]
- Team games suck! ( if your team consists of people with peanut sized brains, then you are eliminated)
- Ping issues when playing team games sometimes.
- Some levels do need a rework.
- Hackers!!!!

yellow team bad,True
"I like the overall idea of the game, however it could be executed better.

Firstly, team modes are trash. They are pure RNG and no matter how good you play, you can still lose if you have bad players in your team. This can be very frustrating to get through the first couple of maps and lose just because your team wasn't good enough.

Secondly, it is pretty subjective but IMO it would be better if maps were harder overall. Currently the main challenge in the game are enemy players. The map itself isn't a big threat if you have at least a little bit of skill and luck. This is especially true about ""race to the top"" maps. Sometimes it is just enough to keep moving forward to win in those. I personally lost in those only by bad luck, or by troll players who try to bother you. 

That gets us to third problem. The game doesn't encourage players to bother their enemies somehow. You can ""hold"" enemy players but it doesn't benefit you in any way because by doing so you are wasting your own time, too. There are several team modes that make you use it, but in solo modes this feature is completely useless/used by trolls who are not trying to win at all. That's why I think that it is important to make maps harder overall, by adding more skill based jumping puzzles and obstacles. 

Matchmaking is also problematic. Sometimes it just takes too long to find a lobby, or just keeps resetting itself. Also, I know its random but it gives me a feeling that this game has only 3 maps, which isn't true. It just keeps rolling to these same maps. Also, they definitely should add more maps and modes. This game is not F2P but amount of content in this game makes me think that it should've been.

My last, personal problem is constant disconnects. I don't have any idea why it keeps happening. My internet is fine and it only happens in this game, at least in such frequency. Very frustrating.",False

EDIT: After the new update, I believe most hackers are gone, I haven't seen a hacker within 7-10 games that I played. However, servers are down literally most of the time. Any time I want to play solo (it's been about 6 different occasions) I cannot connect to a server. It's not just me. Game still lacks so much content. It's still very buggy.

would recommend if they actually fixed the hacker issue, but getting 3 hackers in lobby really kills the fun aspect of this game.

"It's a hacker's paradise.
No anti-cheat,
No report feature in-game,
No usernames in-game,
Devs don't care enough to do anything about the hackers.

In-game names are generic ""Fall Guy 0000"" which hundreds of other people might have, making reporting useless unless you remember your ""support number"" which is located on screen.
Problem with that...
The report function on their website doesn't work.

They also claim that their ""anti-cheat"" already sees the hackers and will ban them ""next game.""
Not useful at all, really, as many of them have cosmetics that require multiple crowns (currency you get from winning) to purchase.
Proving that their ""anti-cheat"" does not work.

Other than that, the game is fun as hell and thrilling to play.
Shame the devs have done so little to make it fair.

IF the hackers are dealt with using better anti-cheat methods, I will update this review, seeing as I am past the point of no returns.

"Has potential, but still quite not there.

The good:
+ Wanky funny physics
+ Fun to play and fun to watch
+ Colorful scenarios and cutesy gameplay

The bad:
- Micro transactions (not ground breaking, is just cosmetics you are buying)
- You can troll and of course, be trolled pretty easily with the grab mechanic. This makes running minigames extremely tedious if someone is trying to give you a hard time
- Too little variety of maps with absolutely no differences (you could play the exact same mini game 10 times in a row and no even a bit of RNG in some platform placements to make it exciting)
- Trip mechanic unpolished, your ""fall guy"" will live up to its name and randomly trip over in any situation after a jump or a dive, or even going down a small slope

The ugly
* For the price... it gets repetitive extremely fast. There are lots of games in this genre with more content for less money (or the same price)
* You can't change your name so you are just ""Fall Guy NNNN""

I really liked the concept and this is a great take on ""battle royale"" games, but they should have put more content before shipping it, as it is, feels like a typical Early Access to me.

"abso-fucking-lutely. If you ever watched MXC or even Wipeout and thought ""Man, id love to participate in that"" then this is the game for you. Only have a few hours so far but i'm constantly thirsty for more.

its a great way to stay in shape,True
"It's like Mario Party with a bunch of humanoid beans where nobody knows what they are doing.

Types of stages:
- The races are very fun, but can sometimes be too punishing for making a single mistake.  This is often due to being trampled or the stages being too short.

- The survival stages fit right into the theme of the game.  They allow you to focus more on targeting other players as opposed to a mad dash to the finish.  You can choose to try to mess with other people and play mind games, and your reward is having fewer other people to compete against in later stages.  Just make sure you don't make yourself fall in the process.

- The team games are honestly a nice change of pace most of the time.   Teams are usually just big enough that one person can make a noticeable difference.  There are obviously cases where a loss is out of your control which can be frustrating.

- The tail grab stages are also not too bad once you get the hang of the stages and movement.  However, since this game is online, it often feels like you are getting grabbed from out of nowhere.  But, people who enjoy chase games like Dead by Daylight would enjoy this and have an advantage.  The tail grab finale is way too long though.  It would make sense if you had to hold onto the tail longer instead of only worrying about having the tail when the time runs out.

- The puzzles currently available are some of the weakest stages.  You can use observation to be able to tell where to go but it often feels like it comes down to being in the right place at the right time.  If you count the Hex-A-Gone finale as a puzzle, then I would say that is an example of a good puzzle/survival.  Matching fruit is not fun, though.

Something to note is that all of the stages are more interesting and engaging than they look because of how many other people you are playing with.  It looks repetitive but often does not feel that repetitive because of the other players.

"The game is too expensive for what it costs. Please don't listen to all those positive reviews telling you to rush on the game as if it was the Holy Grail. At the moment, it's just an overhyped game and there's nothing spectacular about it.

Many people say it's ""fun with friends"", but there is literally no interaction with your friends except 1 game out of 5 in a football minigame, and, unfortunately, the game or the servers are probably gonna crash at this point.
Many crashes on a high-end PC at the beginning or at the end of games.
Forced to Alt+F4 many times to have a playable gaming experience.

I can admit that Fall Guys is fun when there's no crashes or when you don't clip through hexagons or balls, but even then the randomness of the team minigames takes away all the fun to replace it with frustration.
All in all, i'd consider buying this at 10 bucks MAX when the game is FIXED and more games are added.

"Review time:
I have won 3 matches so far so this isn't just because I can't win.

Firstly I really do like this game but there are just so many things that really upset me that I really cannot recommend at this stage but do believe the game will improve.

1) Server issues. The developers don't think it's fair to be judged on this because some how it's not their fault. Sorry your had the bad planning of how you launched this title. If I bought a first person shooter and the developer didn't plan ahead to put ammo in the game, I would as equally annoyed.

2) Team games modes can do one. They are too open to RNG of your team mates. I got eliminated so many times due to this. Especially Fall Ball (football/soccer) when team are always uneven 5v4 or 6v5. It can't be that hard to code this games only with even teams.

3) Tip Toe - Biggest pile of crap of a game mode. Completely luck. You have to basically not help and be a jerk to win and suck of the success of others. Those who try mostly lose.  This mode would be much better if everyone have their own paths to figure out.

4) Jinx can do one - Every game I played it comes down to each team hunting the last person, always 1 left either side. Complete coin flip, you might as well walk away for two minutes and come back to see if your have progressed.

5) Sea Saw - If you get the front row and you got some basic skills with movement, easy win, your racing by yourself. Once you get 3rd or 4th row start, well enjoy relying on other players to get you to the finish line, sacrificeing themsevles to do so. This would be a better team game, yellow vs Blue, where each team need to get 50%(?) across the line to win, meaning working together to get across.

To be honest there is probably a lot more for me to rant about but I can't think of it at this time.",False
"A wonderful game to have fun, even by yourself, or with your friends.",True

Was fun until I started playing,True
best game,True
Waste of money,False
"A collection of minigames that existed in other games as mods or custom maps, but paid AND with a bunch of microtransactions (albeit, just cosmetic ones). Low gameplay diversity, low amount of maps and mechanics, part of which are absolutely infuriating and rely mainly on luck. Team minigames are the the worst in this regard. Good for having some fun with friends, but even bad games can be fun if played together with someone you enjoy spending your time with.Also, the last update with the anticheat absolutely BROKE Linux support. More than two weeks have passed since game's launch, so no one is eligible for an automatic refund. Me and my friends cannot play together anymore and can't even automatically refund our copies because the studio made this decision.",False
"Full of bugs and cheaters, every new update gets worse",False
its really boring after like 4 hours,False
Doesn't work on linux since last update.,False
"Cannot recommend this game.  Devs have not been instilling much, if any, confidence in their ability to create a lasting or working game.  For example, due to a bug, the dev team disabled Player names. You are instead given a number.  This is a problem that one would imagine would be fixed in a day or two, but it has been several weeks and there is still no fix on the horizon.  Imagine a dev team that can't even fix a bug that allows players to have names in 2020.  This is utterly disqualifying.  I can't think of any other game that has this problem and it speaks to the dev's incompetence. 

Second example; this is a winner takes all game and cheating is rampant.  If you spot a cheater in your game (and there are PLENTY) there is no reason to continue.  You cannot compete with the cheats and you will not win.  The cheating effectively breaks the game.  Given that the dev team can't even fix their name issue, I have zero confidence they will create an effective anti-cheat or solve the problem in any meaningful way.  

There is also an extreme lack of variety of maps.  The games become very repetitive very quickly and thus, boring. 

If you buy this game, you may enjoy it for a couple hours, but it will eventually become an uninstalled, forgotten title in your games library.  Let my $20 serve as a cautionary tale against future titles from this dev team.

"Hackers have ruined the game, isn´t funny anymore",False
"Game is currently filled with cheaters. About 1 in 2 games has them, ghosting around the map with speed and flying hacks. Terrible experience currently. 

How the devs are unable to implement some simple anticheat is a mystery to me. There are obvious mathematical checks you can do, based on speed, direction etc. that will at least get rid of a good majority of hackers...  No reporting of any kind since you have a pseudo 'account' with a generic ID. BTW, playstation has names tied to your PSN ID. Why not tie one to the steam id ?? Keep making skins and swim in the cash this game made tho !",False
"Fun game concept, but these devs have totally dropped the ball. For the first several weeks I was getting disconnected from over 50% of matches. Now that seems to be mostly sorted out, but there are now blatant cheaters in most matches with no report mechanism. My advice is to pass on this game, someone else will come along and implement the same type of game more competently.",False

its so infuriating dont play if you have anger issues,True

A great game with a lot of potential but sadly filled with bugs at its current state. As of purchasing there is no way to obtain Crowns (the games main skin currency) without using some kind of hacks. if you see anyone in a lobby with a time gated skin they are simply GameShark to obtain these crowns.

"Overall good and fun game. However the co op minigames have to be somehow balanced as there are trolls who will intentionally make you lose. Random disconnects occur sometimes and it gets frustrating especially when in the final stages of the game.

Also the co-op minigames feels super bad when most people in your team have no idea what to do.

I hope more minigames are added in the future as round 1-2 are really repetitive and can get really boring so is 5th.",True

You get such a rush of excitement as you get closer to the finals every episode. The models and graphics make the game so much more enjoyable, and the upbeat music correlates so well with the game's style and theme. The randomised mini-games and online gameplay with up to 60 players makes every match a new experience. I'd definitely recommend it to people wanting to reduce stress and have fun.",True

"This game is Great, but now I have to share my PC with everyone in the House…
... It is [b] more Fun than I thought and its lasting a lot longer [/b] that I could have guessed...

If you are concerned or do not know if this game is for you, I will talk my experience playing it, about the current state and what is planned for the Future.

[b] What is this game: [/b] Fall Guys is a totally different approach to the Battle-Royale genre, the lobby is composed by 60 players, there will be “Trials” along the match and in each of them a portion of players will be eliminated, the last survivor wins a [b] Crown [/b] that can buy you Legendary or Epic costumes.

[u] [b] The Positives: [/b] [/u]
[list]
    [*] [b] For Everyone [/b] – It is really made for Everyone, many people that didn’t have any interest on Videogames are playing and enjoying. So simple to learn and there is not much space to improve, so if you can’t play all day, there is always a fair competition going on between all the players.
    [*] [b] Simplicity [/b] – The game has 4 commands, you can Move, Jump, Dive and Grab, making it one of the easiest games to learn and intuitive to play.
    [*] [b] Mini Games [/b] – There are currently 24 Levels available, being some Free-for-All and others in Teams, most of them are well designed and unique, almost every mini-game you can come up with a new strategy, the new RNG system is also great for Casual players.
    [*] [b] Amazing with Friends [/b] – Even after playing for 100 Hours, when me and my friends join to play together, we always have a good time. The lobby have a maximum capacity of 4 players.
    [*] [b] Customization [/b] – The game provides a lot of variations to personalize your character, from Color to Clothing, even some costumes being from other Games (Limited Time on the Store, like Portal/TF2/My Friend Pedro and many others), making a wide range of combinations! 
    [*] [b] Regional Price [/b] – Here in Brazil is something to be Praised, our money is not worth much, but we can Still buy games for a fair price, props to Devolver on this one.
[/list]
[u] [b] The Negatives: [/b] [/u]
[list]
    [*] [b] Nicknames [/b] – For now, everyone is called Fall Guys and 4 random digits, I don’t know why this is going on, but they should fix it and make your friends names be more visible.
    [*] [b] Connection [/b] – It is not very common to lose connection during a match, but when it happens is persistent and very frustrating, you lose all your earnings along that specific run. Here in South America we don’t have dedicated servers, resulting in a few Lag spikes as well.
    [*] [b] Minor Bugs [/b] – Very Rare to happen, but in a few Mini-games you might fall more than you should, get stuck in a platform or get thrown a little too far.
    [*] [b] Cheating [/b] – I have seen a few cheaters along my playtime, but I know there is a lot of them out there and it might be the thing that keeps you not enjoying the game, but it’s an issue Devolver is already pursuing, [b] the last update they introduced an Anti-cheat system [/b] to start punishing these players, we have to wait to see the Results.
[/list]
[b] The Mid-Season Update: [/b] Launched on 15/09/2020, introduced more variety and randomness to the current levels, making it a lot more enjoyable and less robotic, and they also introduced an Anti-Cheat system.

In my opinion, I see a pretty good potential in this game, I did not have this much fun with a game in a long time and the Developer seems really invested in this project… After a month since release, we are getting new costumes to collect, which I really enjoy collecting, they are polishing the game and planning a long-term life of the game with Seasons. The cheating problem is on work right now, we must pray that it will prevent malicious players...
I am looking forward for the next season, which is already announced to be Medieval themed, with new Mini games and Map Mechanics. I think soon enough will be a lot more games like this one, so enjoy while it is not exhausted like every other new game.

"While I enjoyed this game when I bought it, it has since become borderline unplayable with 3/4 games being ruined by cheaters. For a game to be released in 2020 without ANY form of anti-cheat really isn't acceptable.",False
"Fun casual game, kinda different and reminds you of mario party but a lot less ""board game"" and all the mini games! I just wish the servers were more stable and when I do get dropped it dont save the score/game I was in and I just wasted my time, still good game for the price.",True

Nothing has ever given me a faster heart attack than seeing that a player just grabbed me. I know for a fact that im completely safe but boy oh boy that strikes fear. Ez recommend,True
Yes,True
"Fall Guys is a amazing game. It's so nice to fire up and just let loose playing a few games, it could easily act as a stress reliever or a pain in the ass. My only gripe with the game is the team game modes, not only are they boring, they drag on and if your stuck on a team full of unskilled players there's absolutely nothing you can do to advance which makes it even more frustrating as the team balancing is terrible. Other than that it is a great game and I highly recommend it!",True

also remove fall mountain

no dedicated/private servers - pc games should not be going full console matchmaking, its the bread and butter of pc gaming

other than that, super cool game

"Good game. Family fun.

EDIT: After playing a bit more and seeing the pain that is this game, I have to say that I don't agree it's worth $20. The game is fun, yes, and it CAN be good, but right now? No. It's not even the server issues either, that's whatever. I don't like how I can't consistently play a game and it's dumb that it's come down to ""This is how games are now,"" I digress though.

The issue of this game for me and what seems like a lot of people are: team games. There are two good team games, no more no less. Team Tail Grab? That was dumb, I could hold on to my tail for the entirety of the start to finish but because of the RNG of everyone else and their skill levels I get eliminated?

There is also the issue of the match game, and the slime run. They are unbalanced and even though I like the slime run, it could/would be much more fun if it was legit a last round thing, first person to make it wins. No crown grab, nothing. That game mode has ended with almost no one winning, I've seen videos of only 6 people making it and it was the third/second round.

Last issue is the fact that the game is stuck on a 4 player squad, in a 60 man game. I understand the aspect of BRs being 4-mans and that's usually the idea, but why is 4 the max in this one? Could you not do 10, or something much more streamer friendly? Make custom games, allow us to make smaller games and editing what minigames are in it, you'd create an actual community and not just a one-off game that everyone is gonna play for a few weeks and then you fall into obscurity again.",False

i bought it because of its hype and the game is fun and bit frustrating when you're knocked over and over again although you'll have your moments. its definitely worth it if you have at-least one friend to play with. team games are boring and total luck if you get bad team-mates you're not likely to win. 
we definitely need more maps and workshop support as improvement, the game is little boring and repetitive after couple of hours due to the limited content.

"This game is quite fun when all things are working as intended. The mini-games are enjoyable, the characters and their various skins add a ton of variety to the pool of players you encounter each match, and the way progression of cosmetic unlocks is handled is both fair and engaging. In it's purest form I'd say there's no question you'll enjoy this game so long as you understand its strengths and faults.

The biggest strengths the game has is the easy drop in matchmaking and it's very simple yet property used control scheme. With these two things you have a game that you can literally pick up and play a full match within 2-20 minutes depending on how far you progress among other factors, and do so with a low learning curve that still provides a varied experience between matches. Matches start with 60 players and the ensuing chaos with having so many people competing in tiny levels means you can't guarantee how things will play out as even small decisions players make around you can greatly affect how your session goes.

My favorite rounds are the races as they have the most levels, are pretty balanced, and don't rely on grab mechanics to play. Part of the game's appeal is the almost lemming-like behavior you end up experiencing alongside your fellow players as you all make the same mistakes back-to-back whether it be all jumping on a see-saw corner and having it tip you off or seeing one player jump and hit a non-moving door only to have 2-3 other players do the same thing as if to test its durability. The race hazards also add a bit of physics fun to things as while in many cases they're designed to make you fall off the stage or tumble over, they can also be used to launch you ahead of your opponents or even to grab other players and sabotage them with bumpers that are moving back and forth.

One thing to note is that the game isn't designed to have a particularly high skill ceiling and I'd argue it has the opposite. While skill and player experience definitely plays a factor in victory, the physics and overall design of the game lend it to be one that levels the playing field between the hardcore with great motor skills and reactions and the more casual player that might be fairly young or is a working adult that rarely has time to play games and just wants to relax. If you're looking for a game that gives you the opportunity to hone your skills, pit them against others in a competitive format, and have a ton of strategies and techniques to learn, this likely isn't for you.

The biggest faults the game has is the lag compensation / client-side authority and rampant cheaters. While I can't say with certainty how the game handles decision making, there are instances where what it decides has transpired leaves a bit to be desired and I can't say if it's how the devs handled lag compensation or if there's just some decisions that the clients get to make that are rather questionable. The most obvious would be how successfully grabbing other players often plays out. You'll play a level based around grabbing another player ( say to grab a tail off of them ) and have to get really close to them to grab. However others can grab you from further away, sometimes a LOT further away to the point where you're unsure who even did it. While it requires you to be able to make contact with them it feels as if they just have to be within 2-3 character lengths of you to do it and thus both your ability to predict and react are greatly inhibited.

This client-side authority might also play into the rampant and blatant cheater problem the game is currently suffering. It's by far the worst offender of what would otherwise be an extremely positive review. Viewing other reviews and peeking at the community hub reveals that it's so common and pervasive that it's almost all people talk about. The cheats range from movement speed, flying, and auto puzzle solving but there may be others. Each of these aren't just minor advantages either as races that would normally take at least 45 seconds to a minute instead take the cheater seconds to win. Puzzles that require remembering icon locations or trial and error falling tile mazes are automatically solved on the cheater's side which give them absolute confidence and swift action upon that round starting ( assuming they didn't just fly to the finish or hover when tiles vanish ). 

I've played a bit over 6 hours in the game and thus a couple dozen matches, and with no exaggeration I've encountered blatant cheaters in every other match. Sometimes 2-3 at a time, and mind you the keyword here is ""blatant"". There's no doubt a few players in those matches have but don't flaunt their cheats and use them strategically whenever they'd otherwise lose a round. Maybe a quick speed boost for a second to make it look like rubber-banding, or pretending to not already have the tile falling maze solved and just playing along until near the end. In either case having just one cheater in your match of 60 players drastically reduces your chance for victory and will help ruin any team-based rounds. Even if you're okay with not winning you'll still get upset when cheaters use their flying to knock you off the stage and disqualify you.

So my verdict? The game is worth picking up and playing but keep in mind its current state. The devs seem to be aware of the cheater problem so there's hope in their exploits being patched in the future, but right now it's a nasty flaw that has to be factored in with the game. Due to how the game's name masking works you can't simply just block cheaters from future interactions so you have to rely on the dev's statement that ""any cheaters you encounter are having their first and last experience with the cheats as the anti-cheat has flagged them and will be banned"" as you have no way of knowing if they get banned yourself. They've been flooded with support tickets related to the issue that they had to close submissions on their Twitter so there's no doubt pressure for them to nip the problem's source rather than simply have the anit-cheat play damage control. Better to have no way to exploit speed and flying rather than just banning anyone who manages to do it.",True

"Fun game, has its problems with hackers and repetition but great replay value especially with friends. Can virtually be microtransaction-less.",True
"The PC version of this game is full of hackers who can fly around and run at the speed of light. Which is pretty sad considering Fall Guys is a competitive online multiplayer. All player names are censored (even those of party members!?), which makes everyone get away with cheating easily.

The best part though is that there isn't even an option to report those players in the first place, because the devs are too lazy to get after them anyway.

Furthermore, the servers seem to be very overloaded most of the time, causing you to sometimes miss easy jumps, get grabbed from 5m away, or even have other players teleport short distances. Which is especially frustrating when stuff like this prevents you from progressing and winning in clutch situations.

Overall this game might be a refreshing experience and some fun entertainment for casual players, but way too frustrating for competitive ones. For 20 bucks, you would also at least expect some anti-cheat measures.",False

"Too many cheaters, needs to be patched. Ruins the game.",False
umm no,False
"I have to say this game is fun, and don't get me wrong, I would recommend to play, the only reason why I am saying no is to get the attention that this deserves, I somehow been finding myself playing against lot of hackers, I tried to report this and don't get any attention, you first get the message about: don't report, we already got the hackers, which is not true, since they're still popping in every other match. Then if you still proceed to report, they send you an email right away saying: oh, this is already resolved, like... what? I just reported and 5 seconds later this is already fixed? but then again, still get hackers every other game.
I like how the community plays on team matches and play against the hacker (like its own team), but I feel like losing matches, or stopping playing because of that is no fair for the players, sure, this is to have some fun, this game is so cool, but why would the developers won't really fix this? I feel like there should be a reporting option in game where you can actually report the player without much problem, and more important than that, is to do something about it!
Anyways, again, the game is great, but I feel you guys should do something about it before is too late and people start getting tired of it and stop playing, I wouldn't like that to happen to this game!",False

To explain it quicly its basicly you paying 20 euros to throw a dice or to gamble and to then just rage because just as for any gamble you always lose.

Besides that, almost half of the players who would normally have 100+ ping just threw away 20 euros on this shit game because they can't even play it due to them getting instantly disconnected. I  could go on about this for a very long time but im not gonna waste my time anymore then i already have writing a comment about this shit game. If u don't get what i mean by this comment then just waste 20 euros buy this game and then probably break ur pc and write a comment just like mine cuz this game will make u rage and ruin your day.

"This game is good, unique and super fun. However, due to so many people playing, others started to cheat. Some are blatant some just uses it on finals, or when they're losing or whatever. There is a cheater almost every game I queue and it sucks and I don't think they're doing something to fix this problem hence why they're already promoting season 2 even though it'll be more than a month to release. 

They didn't have option to report a player in-game.
Their customer support is so bad, I've reported some couple of blatant cheaters, bugs and missing crowns (a reward you get when you win) and  they never respond.
I don't even think that their anti-cheats are working or even exist.

Overall this game is awesome and has so much potential but Mediatonic aren't putting much of an effort into improving this game.

I'm tired of raging and actually want an even selection of maps, but it feels like dpending on the day of the week you get 1 map in over 50% of your games...

Don't waste your time or money.  Nothing enjoyable about this when almost every round is now won by cheaters/hackers/modders.,False
"Fall Guys is a Battle Royale game comparable to (and very likely inspired by) the TV show Takeshi's Castle. A game (called ""episode"" ingame) consists of 4-5 rounds and happens on different maps and different play modes. The game starts with 60 players max. Every Round, a certain number gets terminated through different rules. These can be races, where you have to reach the finish line as fast as possible, games where teams have to complete objectives together, or other rules.

As servers are problematic right now and I struggle to connect to games, I decided to do a review to give my first expressions from playing and watching streamers.

Pro:
- fun, addictive and fast paced gameplay.
- Easy to pick up for beginners (tested on my GF) and people who don't play video games often.
- super high potential for future updates. The game modes already present are very promising for future modes.
- Many customisation options. Most options can be unlocked by ingame currency that gets earned by playing the game (or can be bought with money).
- Easy and precise controls. I never died because the game feels unresponsive which is a great sign for these types of games.

Neutral:
- Ingame Shop works without any problem.
- A few options are locked behind purchasable DLC.
- Achievement hunters will struggle to get the game to 100% because the Achievment ""Infallible"" is super hard.

Con:
- Server stability is problematic right now. Sometimes you can't find games, sometimes games get terminated in the middle of a run. I hope this get fixed soon, because this makes playing the game frustrating.
- Team-Modes sometimes start with uneven Player counts, making these modes very unfair. I hope they change map selection so team-Modes do not get picked when there is an uneven player count left.
- No offline mode.
- No Split Screen Co-Op.
- No Crossplay yet.
- No ingame option to change the language. It is based on your windows region setting. Tip: To change this, Press your windows button, type ""Region"" and select the first option. The first drop-down called Country and region is the option that matters.

Overall I  recommend this game. However, right now the server problem needs to be fixed, as games sometimes get terminated in the middle of an episode. I am sure this will get fixed soon, if not i will update the review.
I believe 20€ the game is a fair deal for what is offered. The developer has already teased that they will add new features, levels and customisation options in the future and the early success of the game makes me hopeful that it will be supported for a longer time. Therefore i will update this review as new updates get released to reflect these changes.",True
"Is the game fun? yes. are they making changes to known problems with the games to improve quality? yeah. but i just can't recommened it. as long as they can't fix the hackin issue. having a hacker in this game is absolute pain. you know you can't even compete with em and it just ruins the fun. and after a month passed every second to third round has a hacker... they get more. a little sad that a game developer that earns 20 bucks per game on steam is too lazy to develope an antihacking tool, than the persons that code the hacks that dont earn a single buck. but at least we have a sneak peek on the new games and outfits that the cheaters gonna beat the crap out of us.",False

"This game is a great game to play with friends, It reminds me of the more forgiving GMOD deathrun server,however this game is plagued with script kiddies, because this game let's you use Cheat Engine in a multiplayer game in 2020.

The developers claim if you see a cheater it means their anti-cheat will kick in and ban the script kiddie running fly hacks after the game, every script kiddie rocks 10 crown costumes and almost every game has 1-2 people insta teleporting to the finish making the games a waste of time if your 5 seconds into a round and you see people qualifying.  

Another thing about this game is there needs to be a way to add people to your party without adding them as a steam friend, it's an extra step that makes playing Fall Guys with internet strangers annoying especially if you find yourself on a discord server playing with random people.

Until these things are fixed I would recommend holding off on the game until the issues are fixed or buy the game on sale especially because there isn't a way to report hackers in-game, If I were someone contemplating buying this game, I would wait until Season 2 comes out and check the reviews to see if the devs actually implement an anti-cheat that kicks cheaters.

"Fall Guys is a lot of fun, especially with friends! It is a colorful, wacky, cute party game with a lot of charm. With that said, I cannot recommend this game as it is. This is due to the following reasons:

[b]Fly Hacks[/b] - Seriously, I don't know what kind of person cheats in a game like this, but the games are full of hackers. I have had many final rounds at Fall Mountain where it looks like I am going to win, only to watch a fly hacker fly in and steal the win. It completely ruins the fun of the game given how often this happens. While you can report these guys via their support email, you only ever get the generic response back and don't know if the cheater will be banned or if the developers are doing anything to combat this long-term.

[b]Repetitive Maps[/b]  - I know it is early days, but I really feel this game should have gone out with more maps (shows). Don't get me wrong, I enjoy most of them (except for See Saw), but it is lacking in variety a bit. In Season 2 I see they will release new maps into the rotation so that is good to see.

[b]Game Crashes[/b]  - This happens often enough to mention it. I have also lost final matches due to random disconnects (internet is fine on my side). This supposedly has been patched but it still happens on occasion.

[b]Unbalanced Team Games[/b]  - Being down a player in the Rock 'N' Roll game or in Fall Ball is really noticeable and leaves you at a pretty bad disadvantage. It would be better if the system avoided team games when the numbers are uneven. With some team games it isn't as bad...

[b]Names[/b]  - Why cant we create user names? Also why is it so hard to pick out your party members during the match, on the post-game screen, and during spectator mode? 

Things I would personally like to see added in addition to the above:

[b]Stats page[/b]  - would love to track my wins and losses on each map, maybe an overall ranking system, etc.
[b]Tradable items[/b]  - Be able to trade cosmetic items with others.
[b]Map Voting[/b]  - Perhaps a system where players can vote for the next map or a select random person is given the choice. It would be great to have a map veto system to decrease the likelihood of maps you dislike from showing up, but admittedly I do not see this being very feasible. 

I know it sounds like I am bashing this game a bit. However, I do love Fall Guys and know it has so much potential to grow even further. I also understand it is early days and the devs were not expecting the success that the game garnered. Sadly, the above issues simply ruin the fun of the game for me, but if these can be ironed out, I will be happy to change my review and recommend this game!",False
it's not woth 25 dollars,False
"The game is a real joy to play with friends, fun mini-games, great characters and outfits.
But for now, I would recommend people to lay of this on PC atleast, the game is severely invested with hackers, I encounter one hacker I once was lucky enough to spot 5! teleport hackers in 1 game, just my luck.

"The easiest yet most difficult battle royal game in the market.

here's why?
- It's easy for you to win a game until you get to the finals where there is only one winner
- Playing the team minigames can be the easiest thing in the world, or the hardest thing you've ever done while trying to blame your team.

at least you can grab someone and make them lose too....",True
"In its current state, I wouldn't quite recommend it.  Though in the future as more content is released, I'm sure that will change.  As of now however, the game just becomes tedious after a few hours.  What were funny physics, and interesting maps in the beginning, just became sources of frustration.  

Just tonight, while in the lead on the way to the crown in Fall Mountain, someone behind me got hit by the hammer before the steps, and launched into me knocking me down, but keeping them upright allowing them to get an easy win (this is just the most recent instance like this, but these sorts of things happen in every match). 

I know the physics were a selling point at first, but when the only constant source of Crowns (the highest tier currency) can only be earned through winning Episodes, and the store is constantly rotating its items, it puts an emphasis of trying to rush to gather as many wins as possible to buy that cosmetic item you really want, but the game itself doesn't gel with a strong desire to win because it takes just as much luck, as it does skill.  This would normally be fine, but again the need for Crowns makes this rough (I wish you were rewarded a crown for finishing in the top 3 of an individual race, and pumping up the cost of items a bit to compensate).  

Couple the above with a relatively limited amount of maps, a good chunk of which are taken up by terrible team games.  Doing well in a lobby?  Have fun when you get saddled with a terrible team who prefers grabbing each other, than pushing the ball.  Again, this is fine if the currency system didn't demand a high amount of wins (to purchase a crown set such as the Hotline Miami outfit, you need 10 Crowns total - 10 full episode wins).  Also, a few of the maps shown in the trailer and images for the game, aren't in the game at all, or have their design changed a good bit.

There's a good, fun game underneath the surface of everything, but it just isn't there yet.  Hopefully Devolver Digital makes some needed changes (like community maps), and in the process turns the game into a solid one worth returning to multiple times.",False

The main problem is with the team matches, most of the time due to the player number there is always one team with most players than the othe(s), and having player less or AFK means that 99% of the time your team is going to lose.

Outside team matches there are some maps that are simply not fun, like Fruit Chute, Perfect Match and Tail Tag.

"Fun game, however:

1) No anti-cheat/anti-hack for this game, so you will see your fair share of bull on this game.
2) Servers cannot handle the amount of players. You will find yourself getting butt grabbed across a football field while trying to headbutt a soccer ball. Or your butt plug of a tail will get ripped out as if someone is trying to start a lawn mower when their ,15 meters away.
3) On some levels, such as Hex-A-Gon, you may find yourself falling to the level below you. Just to find out you hit that tile just right and fazed through onto a lower level, which may or may not want to send you to the shadow realm.

As stated before, fun game to play with friends. However, wait a month to see if they will either fix their game or the game will die off abruptly. Worst case, you save some money or you could refund it! 
",False
"

This review is from a solo-player perspective. If you're gonna play in teams with friends, your experience may vary. 

If you're playing solo, you'll have fun for a few hours. If you're planning to play for longer, you won't enjoy the game playing solo.

The purpose of the game is to be the best out of 60 players to win Crowns, a currency to buy skins/emotes. You'll quickly notice that accomplishing this solo is not worth the time and effort. Pre-made teams will have huge advantage, and there's also a HUGE luck factor in the finals games. Winning Crowns without the help of a team is incredibly rare, and requires luck. Skill is the smallest factor.

The game is infested with hackers who'll increase their speed by small amounts, making it barely noticable, but enough to give them an edge. This will make your experience even more frustrating.

Team games don't work very well because of lag. Pushing/kicking a ball in 2 of the games is wonky and doesn't work due to desyncs. Too many people contest over pushing one ball, resulting in a chaotic and random experience. When you throw yourself at a ball, 80% of the time you'll clip through the ball and it won't move in the direction it should. Other team games aren't much more fun.

Some of the games are too easy and take too much time. And you'll be doing them over and over if you want to reach the finals to have a shot at winning the Crown. There is very little game variety, and you'll quickly feel bored of them.

In the race levels, if you manage to get ahead of the crowd you'll finish with ease. If you get stuck in the crowd, you'll keep falling and ragdolling because when you jump, any contact with other players will instantly put you in ragdoll state. It takes a long time to stand up, which usually means you'll fall into a pit and be put even farther behind other players. There is no skill there, just pure dumb luck.

I'm already bored, tired and frustrated of this game. As a solo player it's a terrible experience. Might be fun with well-coordinated teams.",False
"Most of the levels get old really quickly, there's not much of a point besides farming for other skins. The skins come up so infrequently in the store that it's not even much of a motivation.

It's ok for a bit, and for $20 it's not that bad of a purchase, but really there are tons of better games for this price.",False
"these incompetent developers should have built this game with server-side authoritative physics, but because they let the client take complete control of their own character (as opposed to sending inputs to the server and positions/rotations back to each client who then interpolate between any discrepancies), the game is ruined by cheating

this is basic competitive video game networking and speaks to the lack of thought the developers put into this part of the game, and then they have the gall to claim that the cheaters will only be able to cheat in one match as they have tripped their ""anti cheating switch"" and have since been detected, this is a disgusting blatant lie

the game would be fun even with the low variation of minigames, shoddy matchmaking servers, random disconnects, minimal customization, lack of voice/text chat, and glitches such as everyone's username being replaced by some random number, but cheaters ruined this game and it's a huge shame that with this amount of hype and sales, the developers aren't doing anything about it

"UPDATE: Cheaters have taken over. This game is borderline unplayable atm.

Unacceptable PC port  
  
I'm not even complaining about the servers. The game turned out to be way more popular than expected and that usually is a problem for server loads. I won't say anything about the fact that the game won't import my Steam name. That's annoying but doesn't take away much from the game.

If there was nothing more to say I'd still recommend the game, but the last negative ruins far too many matches;

- Cheaters. In like 1/5 matches there's someone with cheats on either flying around at mach 8 or trying to become Barry Allen's next mortal enemy by running to the end in two seconds. Fix it fast or watch the game die.

Unfortunately I still can't recommend this game. Their midseason update has good intentions, learning about the anti-cheat is great, but the way they've altered some levels, overwriting the old ones, instead of adding them as extra variations of the same levels is baffling. There are some races that weren't particularly fun before, and are simply awful now. I'm looking at you See-Saw, I don't even want to win that race. This really fails to address the issue of lack of variety that players were having, because these versions are going to feel as stale and solved as the old versions in little time. Had they kept both and you weren't sure of the patterns before you started it would feel a lot fresher than what they're offering. I'm not even sure any of these feel more ""balanced"", just a variation on a theme. I hope it isn't only every season that we see a couple new levels. If they made the spinner race have 4 different variants that look identical, but change which spinners turn what direction, it would go so much further to keep the races feeling fresh and properly chaotic. All told, don't pay $20 for this game.",False

"FYI: User Knal has a very good revieuw. You should check that out. 

I only have 0.6h in at time of writing but I already have my impressions of this game. 

This is a good game. The negative recomend is for how I feel about the total package. 

BUT...

-Not enough map veraiety. 
-Relies on a lot of luck. 
-Has currency for winners. Since you only have a 1/60 chance to win every game it is hard to get. So you probably won't be able to get the skin you want. 
-If you are someone who rages easely like me. DON'T play this alone. Get a budy to keep you in check. This game looks cute and fun. But the luck can screw you over. (During tail grab I had a tail during the whole game. But when the tamer switched from 0:01 to 0:00 someone grabed it of me somehow. You can guesse the results. My controller disliked it. )

And now what I dislike even more: 
LAUNCH DLC!!! It has become a standard I know. But they have 2! 2 times DLC on launch. 
First they have the collectors pack, 10 euro. I got that one. Since I wanted to support the devs and yes, am used to launch DLC. I also like to get all the stuff for my games. 
BUT THEY WERE SNEAKY AND PUT A SECOND LAUNCH DLC IN! another 5 euro... I got the launch collectors edition, which didn't collect! I feel ripped of like this. 

This is devolver, a company which is generaly seen as a good company for consumers. Now I can see EA, Activision, Ubisoft and the likes coming with 5-10 launch DLC's in the future... Thanks Devolver.",False
"A fun little game but its monetized in a way designed to try to get you to spend by having things only available for awhile. After that they disappear off of store for x amount of time. Can't recommend any game that has a initial fee and then in game store, play a free to play BR, those have stores in them too but don't charge upfront.",False
"Extremely adorable game, with a great concept. Unfortunately, you may as well be casting dice instead of playing any of these minigames. Precise platforming, goofy physics, and bad latency/netcode mix extremely poorly. You can try to do everything perfectly, but you'll get gimped by a invisible players bumping you around while they stand miles away from you. Team games with no communications and extreme imbalance. 
The only way to win is to be lucky, and if you complain, people will give you the good ol' ""haha just get good bro"".

"Fall guys is a really cute and charmingly fun fresh take on the battle royale genre. Got to play some of it before all the server issues started taking place and I have to say it delivered really well on what was expected. Some of the minigames have flaws, obviously, and I hope they implement a system to show you how much time is left in the round before it ends (in certain obstacle courses like see saw where frequently not enough people qualify before the round just ends automatically) as I lost a few rounds despite making it to the end of the level as a surprise timer ended the round without warning.
For 20 USD it is definitely worth full price, but I can't see many people getting into this game past about 50-60 hours or so unless they start adding new modes or holiday themed events, but I don't know what to expect from mediatonic, I just hope this game continues to receive support down the line.

As for launch day server issues, I really hope people stop negatively reviewing the game just for some server issues, clearly mediatonic is doing their best to fix an unexpectedly big launch day, and they are a small development company that wasn't ready for hundreds of thousands of players. Be patient friends, the game isn't going anywhere.",True

But unfortunately, I really can't do that due to how many flaws it has. 

I was going to post a full list of the pro's and cons of this game, but at a certain point I noticed the cons just growing to the point of insanity so I decided to spare you guys that list. Connectivity- and latency issues, most maps being unfair or broken in one or more ways, the rewards system being very grindy, very broken physics, the same maps looping constantly... Well, you get the point.

The cute design of Fall Guys is extremely misleading as well, because the biggest issue in my opinion is how this game is more often than not turned into either a bloodthirsty crusade to become king of the hill, or an absolute troll-fest.

I have currently owned this game for a fair amount of time and I think its the perfect game for kids and people of all ages. its great except for 1 thing that destroys the experience for everyone. The amount of cheaters is beginning to run rampant in this game and makes the games no longer fun. The fact that the developers are spending more time on expanding the game rather than fixing the game is what is the biggest bother. It is destroying the great following it has and pushing the idea that cheaters are allowed to get away with this. I believe that a system ban should be placed on there accounts or even hire some to fix the job since they know how to break the game anyways.,False
fun game but too many hackers and no way to report them,False

extreme hacker problem,False
its a really fun game but there is too many hackers there needs to be a reporting system.,True
WOOO!,True
"It's really good, I would totally recommend it, as long as the devs change some things in the near future.
The outcome of the game should depend mostly on your performance but instead how good or bad everyone else is has a huge impact on the way you perform. Some maps like Seasaw really depend on everyone following a certain path, and when a big chunk of players decides to cluster on the same side of the fuckign seasaw, you know you'll be seeing the loby soon.
Another huge downside for me is the last map Fall Mountain. The position you spawn in at the begining is key and I think everyone should spawn at the same distance from the crown (no front and back row, basically).
Also those less familiar with the map are way more likely to lose, because the map is hard, and that's perfect, but it being the very last map making it so that your only way of playing it is if you make it to the end, means that it will take you a long time to get used to it, given that there's no actual way of practicing, and Fall Mountain can only be played once you reach the end.

I'm not a big fan of the battle royale genre and I think this game has potential. I also believe that whether or not the devs change this few things, this game will soon stop being fun for most, and since it's a casual videogame, your average person won't stick around for long, thus making the matchmaking times way longer and making this game unplayable in most continents. A way around this would be making the game free to play, or investing in advertisement all around the globe.

In any case, it's a fun game, you should totally check it out asap (you might not be able to find a match in a couple months).",True

"Fall Guys is a game of potential

Following a Beta that was a blast to play for streamers and Youtube personalities, Fall guys proves how right everyone was to adore this game, a BATTLE ROYALE done differently.

Featuring:
Highly entertaining minigames in a 60 player Battle Royale format.
Unbridled Chaos
Diverse gametypes
Co-op opportunity

Developer is clearly intent of supporting this game for a long time, with new minigames and cosmetics.

While I hope they won't go microtransaction crazy  it is a very real possibility.

As is, it's entertaining for most, but I can see it losing momentum and interest in time due to currently limited amound of content.

Plenty of reviews right now of people getting the game's rating down, don't let them fool you, like a lot of multiplayer games there were technical issues on launch, that's consumer culture for you.
",True
"Unfortunately the random team games completely ruin any fun this game might be.

Two weeks in this game is FILLED WITH HACKERS.  Don't waste your money.

Controls aren't tight enough, the grab mechanic is trash, you will jump off a ledge right next to someone and you will fall over and they wont for some reason, winning half the maps depends entirely on where you spawn at the start, the 1vs1vs1 team games always turn into 2vs1 and against THE GAME IS FILLED WITH CHEATERS.

This game is an absolute disaster I have no idea why people like it so much.  I have given it multiple tries but between all those issues AND the servers being complete garbage (who doesn't use a dynamic cloud service for online game hosting now a days?!?) I lost all interest and uninstalled today.",False
"Well, Where do I start, I played ALOT of the beta and loved every second of it. The Gameplay is fun and engaging. This to me is the type of game that you can play after a hard day at work, sit down, relax, and not put ANY thought into. It doesn't matter you can get as drunk as you want and you still can't mess up the game mechanics(Trust me I have Tried). 

Now to get down to the actual review.

The Good:

1. The Maps are fun and Engaging
2. The Maps have a degree of challenge
3. The controls are fluid and functional.

The Bad:
1. Currently the game has severe connectivity issue. This being said, this is launch day and the capacity of the severs 
    was vastly underestimated.
2. The emote system is practically useless. How can you emote or expect people to even see the emote if other 
    players,opponents, and teammates are attempting to run the opposite direction.
3. The team events are for lack of a better word horrible
4. There are not enough obsticle courses in the game. There are currently several maps which appear to repeat themselves.
5. For $20 for PC and Steam Players, this game is a little over priced. For $10 or even $15 dollars you could probably justify it. The game could if designed right with updates make up the difference with its store which is designed alot like the FTP game like fortnite
6 There is no SpeedHack protections in place. This means that you have people utilizing scriptkiddie tools to increase their movement speeds to give them an unfair advantage. (THIS MUST CHANGE)

One item to note, the game is currently not cross platform and for games of this type to succeed in this niche market they must be cross platform. This is on the roadmap for Fall Guys according to the publisher, but it is not inplemented at the current time.


In closing, this game has ALOT of potential, if the server issues and loadbalancing gets worked out then this game could rival the best games on the steam market. As of the present time, with all the server issues, Instability, crashes, and Hacking going on, the publisher has a long way to go to win over their base.

For now, I am still going to recommend this game depite it's flaws, because I DO find it fun and do enjoy the content. The developers need to step up their game with their technical department as that is going to be the make or break moment when it comes to whether this game stays or go's.

I cannot, and will not recommend this game until they fix the rampant cheating issue.  There is no way to even report cheaters.",False
"I wouldn't recommend this. I'm usually a sucker for these types of platformer games but this just wasn't my thing.

"This is an amazing concept, and I hope you get the chance to enjoy this game, but it's impossible to recommend in its current state. Wait two months and see if the new season incorporates some much needed improvements and bug fixes. Hopefully they can repair this game before the hype dies down, because it's a great concept on paper, but was clearly released while still in Beta. If you're curious about the long list of issues the game currently has, check the discussions page, but the easiest way to sum it up is that between random number generators and server bugs and unbalanced team based games, there's no purpose to becoming skilled in the game because half the time you lose purely from bugginess and poor design. Other games push you to ""git gud"", but in it's current state you might as well put the controller down and just watch if you survive at random because your chances are pretty much equal either way.",False

I totally agree with a lot of the issues people are bringing up about servers and about the team games being in the picking pool without a filter, but I feel like either of those problems will probably be fixed relatively soon and they'll easily give us more flexibility in what games we want to get into.",True

It is a really fun game to play by yourself and with friends.,True

"I have played this game for quite some time now and I would love to talk about it. Fall guys takes the battle royale and party game genre and puts them into a blender. The smoothie that comes out of that blender is perfect in every way. The gameplay is fun and rewarding and it also has an in-game currency that can be earned at a fast rate if you are constantly making it to the final round and winning. While there are currently issues with the server being at capacity, I do not doubt they will have these issues fixed very soon. While I am on the topic of fixing things and possibly adding things there are a few item clipping issues that could be easily fixed and I would love to see this game supported with more new games and content added. Overall I would most definitely recommend picking up Fall Guys and I give it a 8/10",True
Amazing game and super entertaining!,True
"After 4 hours I still have not seen every mini-game Fall Guys has to offer, that's not to say there have been a lot of repeating events. It has been a lot of fun. Of course there have been some server issues, but realistically that is totally normal during the initial release of an online-only game. The game is great, and the server issues will be fixed. Don't be scared off by the people leaving reviews on initial server performance, they forgot they were supposed to be reviewing the actual game.",True

My advice is wait till they implement a decent anti cheat.",False
"Very fun and gets you to really show your competitive side. However, like every game, it also has it's downsides: 
1. Start of the game can hold 60 players but only four people can be in a group.
2. Servers can lag people out and you can end up being the only one in the group to continue (I do believe this is being fixed.)
3. Large groups in small places is annoying but it's just a part of the game.
4. Refer to #1.
5. Refer to #1.
6. Refer to #1.
7. Still salty about #1.",True
"NOTE: [Please disregard many of the negative reviews about the servers.] 
Like any Massively Online title, the devs needed time to test their servers at full capacity before they could ensure the game could accommodate the massive population. There are many Karens crying about it.
______________________________________________________________

Now that servers are up at full strength, this game is exactly what you'd expect, a battle royale version of shows like Wipeout or Takeshi's Castle (MXC). This game is a great time; Fans of minigame series' will have a blast.

You collect new skins by just playing; Even if you lose, you still get points that you can accrue to buy things from the shop. Winning the ""episodes"" (i.e. individual game session) nets you crowns that can be used to get more rare skins. There are microtransactions, but the skins are purely cosmetic; You do not gain an advantage for buying skins. 
 
This game is enjoyable to casuals and tryhards alike, but like any battle royale if you go into this expecting to win every game you will probably get salty and blame the game like many others ( including myself XD )",True
"I understand this isn't a triple A game.
Nontheless, several streamers play it, distribute beta keys, until August 3rd.

"Look, there's a lot of hype. Is the hype justified? Not at all. Is the game ""good""? Maybe. Would I recommend you pay money for it? No. Maybe $5. The thing is, it can be fun when you start. But there is no depth. It is a simple run and jump, but the mechanics are awkward. Your dude falls over from the slightest touch, which doesn't make the game a fun challenge, it makes it annoying. You can improve to a point, but it feels like a hollow pursuit in the end, as does the entire game. It is just not fun after a couple of hours. Give it a month and nobody will be playing this. 
Oh, and it is broken. It will DC you regularly, it will have unfair moments due to server lag and differences in connection, and it is filled with hackers. So even when you manage to feel the smallest sense of enjoyment, the game DC's you or freezes or spawns you in with the camera locked facing the end, or whatever.

bad servers but its fall guys",True

"editing review as of 23:08 due to glaring issues discovered after having played roughly 100 hours, and here are some points you want to be notified of before buying/playing:

the game is absolutely riddled with cheaters, speedhacking and noclipping all over the place, and there is currently no anti-cheat in place, or any way to report them, i wouldn't list this first if it wasn't a big issue, but since every other game is already ruined from the tart i can already not recommend this game on this front.

the second thing which breaks the game is the latency issues, there is at least a full second delay between you and other players depending on the server and netcode, and when the game makes you interact with other people it becomes super obnoxious, because you might think you are grabbing another person on your screen, in reality you're just grabbing the air, this breaks at least four of the available mini games (the 3 variants of copypasted tailtag games and Jinx), and it makes some of the races look really wonky because you might think you're ahead of another person in a race, on their screen they're actually in front of you.*

those are my two biggest complaints, there's some minor ones as well (lack of maps, some of the games being straight up boring and not fun, constant server crashes and disconnects), but the big two should be the biggest warning, and i won't recommend this game until both are fixed.",False

Very repetitive and overhyped. fun for about 20 minutes until you get bored and close the game.,False

So 30 min play time 50 trying to get into a game only to not connect or able to connect start then game crashes.
Also In game yes you can earn the coins to buy the cosmetics but come on day 1 dlc and a cash shop sorry I don't agree with it especially when you still don't have the base game 100% working and even then im not a fan of cash shops in a game.  Also I have read others defend the devs saying well AAA studios have day 1 problems to.  Yes I agree but they also have made much much more complex games compared  to this.  Also this game had a decent closed beta and when they gave the game to basically every big major streamer on the planet come on you knew the hype would be big and you would have tons of people playing day 1.   If I see improvements then ill update this review but for now hold onto your cash and don't jump in yet.",False

Maybe when there's more content I'll repurchase.",False

- Hackers working together so others can't play at all.

"this is a really bad game. its super luck filled, and whenever you get to the final round, there is a 70% chance its gonna be hexagone, which really sucks. this game is supposed to be a kids game but its just filled with cheaters, bm, and bs. i dont enjoy playing this game for more than two ""episodes"" because the reality of the bullshit hits me every time.",False
"Just refunded the game, doesnt say the game is bad, basically the team modes ruin the whol eexperience. I played 10 games, i won 1 of them and lost 9 of them due to team games, it just ruins my whole game, i will consider buying the game again when the team games are either optional or removed. 

You have to know though that there may can be matches where the servers collapse or something like that, but that dfoesnt make the game bad, its just more than the devs expected. 


Conclusion:

-Good fun game
-Bad teammates 
-Server issues",False
Just legit fun. MTX pretty fair as well every game gives at least 30 of the buggers so no need to purchase at least. Surprisingly full of tension but win or lose your leaving with a smile on your face.,True

"People are spazzing out because the launch day was rocky, they didn't expect so many people to play and servers were overloaded, it happens.

Also people who are complaining about the micro transactions and prices, calm down the battle pass is free and you get like 10k Kudos (in-game currency) and 3 crowns for completion. All it unlocks is cosmetics anyway, so why you heff to be mad?

Anyway, on to my review:
PROS
- Bassline in main menu and loading screens SLAPPs
- Game is like mXc with Human: Fall Flat-like characters and physics
- When servers work games are quick and easy
- No stress when playing, but winning feels good 
- Only 3 buttons (excluding movement/camera)
- Most of the mini games are really fun
- Awesome cosmetics
- Free battle pass that unlocks cosmetics and in-game currency
- One of the best social media account runners, their twitter is awesome
- New maps, features and more planned

CONS
- In-game music is missing those SLAPPin' basslines, I want them on always
- Hex-a-Gone is the final stage game 70% of the time, all the time.
- Rocky servers on launch
- No crossplay (this is planned though)
- Not on Switch or Xbone (is possible with interest)
- No option for private server (also possible with interest)",True

The fact the server was overcrowded show how good the game is I understand the frustration but giving it a bad review just because of that is kind of dumb.

Look at basic games like Epic Minigames on roblox it is similar and had over 100 mini games so you don't get bored as fast.   I was bored within 1.5 hours of playing this game.   The team game concept is also a bit stupid because others will affect your ability to qualify for the next round.   You can't type/communicate to them so whats the point of that.    Anyway I'm sure I have more things but those are the basic things I could think of.  Extremely overrated game, with potential, if they add a ton more mini games.",False

"Good and Bad game.

Pros: 
Mindless fun
Small sense of progression with cosmetics
Addictive
Simple graphics easy for most computers
Varying game modes
Fun with friends
Quick play to jump in fast

Cons:
Forced team play
Poor map designs on many (tip toe) being one and (door dash) being another but there are more.
Repetitive
Disconnections are common with no reward
Progression feels very lacking and so poor replayability
Clunky controls and movement sometimes resulting in random character actions (falling over randomly)
Latency 
High price tag for short game

I am not sure if the game was designed as a money grab or not but it does feel slightly lacking. Either way the high influx of players may give the developers a push to get hard at work to give this game more depth and not just leave it as is.

I don't regret buying it as I am positive we will see some improvements and more content but be warned you are not getting much for your money right now.

"release day bugs: frequently can't leave using ESC when eliminated (and having to alt-f4), get error'd when qualifying or winning and subsequently booted back to main menu, speed hackers (which is pretty hilarious but nevertheless).

Bugs aside, perhaps increasing the randomization of games/maps would be neat because of the 10 or so games I've played, it's been mostly the two same maps (whirlygig & gate crash -- and if you qualify beyond that, team tail tag) so that gets pretty repetitive, pretty quick.

It's a fun game if you get into a lobby w/o running into the above mentioned problems, but I've played 10 of them and only 3 of them have been flawless. Hope to see this remedied soon!

There is allegedly ""cheat detection"" (per Mediatonic's Twitter), but so many of the hackers are clearly repeat offenders because they are using the latest skins that cost Crowns (wins) to buy / using colors or taunts only available at the max level for the season.

- The game is fun and challenging, with many of the activities reminiscent of Takeshi's Castle, Wipe Out, etc.
- When you play with friends or strangers, it is fun all around
- Overtime it does become easier as you play more
- It gives a sense of achievement that EA Games doesn't

Cons:
- The only HUGE con as of writing this is the absurd amount of cheaters this game has. Regardless of reporting them, Mediatonic needs to severely fix the hacker issue.
- There are some of the physics, but they are marginal compared to the cheaters.

Overall it is a fun game. It's even better if you manage to get a fair game without cheaters. I recommend this when the hacker issue has been resolved. Otherwise it's incredibly frustrating where you're close to winning, only for it to be easily snatched away.",True
it plays the same maps over and over and im about 18 hours and there still maps that i never got in the map rotation so this is a giant bug for this game,False
not really fun,False
"While i cant fully discourage you from buying it at some point, this game REALLY needs some work. It IS fun but def not worth 20 bucks. 10 at most if im being super generous. 

-The lag comp is stupid, Ive lost so many rounds because other people behind me got to finish first for no reason, able to grab stuff immediately, and I grab people for 5 whole seconds and nothing happens.
-The second round may as well be a roulette wheel that randomly chooses who gets eliminated, because you really have no control in most of the big team games, and the others like block party and matching are pretty fucking pointless.
-The cheaters, please do something.

Really amateur stuff that shouldnt be a problem in an online game. Get it on sale at 10 dollars at the most. Even if they fix these problems there are only so many modes, I personally have fun but I think for a lot of people it COULD get boring. And since steam refunds are bs, you might play too long before you can get your money back. All in all, it could be a whole lot better, but it needs some work and isnt worth 20.

"First off, the game is fun and is a great as long as you don't take yourself too seriously.  I purchase 4 copies in my household and we were having a blast.

Unfortunately, the game is riddled with connection issues.  But by far the worst part is the hacking.  It's to the point where practically every game has multiple hackers.  With the ability to fly, clip through walls and move at super speed there is no way a legitimate player can win the game.  The game is still fun, but you may have to come to terms with the fact that you will almost never win the game as a non cheater.  

If the hacking isn't dealt with, $20 is too much to ask and it should be F2P.",False
The number of hackers is out of control. Can't start a game without seeing a bean fly off ahead of the pack.,False
amazing game but there is hackers,True
"This game is really fun, but at the moment there are hackers in more than half of my games, making it near unplayable. 

The devs are lying to the playerbase saying that hackers are being detected and banned at the end of games. This is obviously not true since many of them wear costumes that are bought with 10 crowns (10 wins), and you can see videos online of people being placed with the same hacker multiple times in a row, even if they were flying around the whole time. At first, hackers used to start flying at the start of the first round so you could just leave and find another game, which was a minor annoyance. Now many of them just wait until the last few rounds to start cheating, which is very frustrating since they make you waste a lot of time.

The devs need a wake up call, they need to realize that if they don't do something now the game is going to die on PC. I absolutely don't recommend buying it until they work on an actual anticheat system, since like I said the game is unplayable right now.",False
"I thought I'd give the game a chance/give it the benefit of the doubt, with all the people posting about cheaters.
After only just purchasing the game, 7 out of 8 games had cheaters in them... some with multiple in one game.

Ridiculous that there is no real anti-cheat to this game.
Really disappointing.",False

"The first few hour of this game are a very enjoyable experience. However, the more I play the more hackers I see and the more server issues I see. As you and your friends battle it out to see who can survive the longest, a man flying above the stage will look down on you as you perish. In addition to this, there seem to be a great deal of issues with the servers. You can grab onto a player for quite a long time and see no reaction, but they can be two meters away and yet your character is immobile. I would not recommend this game until these issues are fixed. I believe the game was released much too early and could stand for a great deal of improvement.",False

Fun but game is still riddled with constant cheating,False
"I am quitting your game due to cheating. Your detection effort is a joke. It is impossible to play when every game has a cheater. All my games yesterday and today had cheaters. This last game had 6 cheaters. 

On Seesaw, 3 flew directly to finish. 2 others floated to tip a seesaw to 90 degrees. Preventing all others but cheaters to finish the game. They continued to forcefully keep the seesaw at 90 degrees until time ran out.

This is NOT FUN. Cheaters all had tons off rare cosmetics and were very high levels. This coupled with the fact that they were organized and knew how to ruin the game for others, means that your detection methods are a JOKE. Your assertion that ""If you saw a cheater it was most likely their first and last time cheatiang"" is patently false and is only self-serving delusion on your part.

Your servers trust the client. You claim you're winning a cat-mouse gain, when you aren't. And haven't fixed the root-cause of the issue. A true fix is long past due. No matter what you claim, cheating is rampant and your efforts to combat it have failed.

I respectfully quit the game and wish I could get a refund.",False

Other thing I want to talk about is how the people think, I know this doesnt have anything to do with the game but for real people should start being nicer to other people instead of fucking being in the wrong side of a fucking platform in see saw game ! >PLS GET A BRAIN HELP THE OTHERS AND LET THE OTHERS HELP YOU DUMBASS< !

"Completely full of hackers that the devs are barely dealing with. Dont be fooled by their posts about taking so many hackers down, there are plenty to fill their place. Its not uncommon to encounter 5-10 rounds in a row with cheaters. Dont support the devs until this is sorted out in a more effective manner. Plus the constant server issues, and game crashes. I regularly have to end task through task manager because the game freezes up in menus. Because of server errors I had to be reinvited to my friends lobby 15 times over the course a few hours today and that isnt uncommon. Figure your shit out mediatonic",False
"this game is fun for a little bit but when you played every map it just gets really boring. i feel like this game could be alot better if the took out some of the bad games out (tail tag) (memory) and added some new games once in  a while. this game came out in like July and there has been no content updates, also the amount of hackers is insane, almost 1 in 5 games for me has a hacker in it. if they could make an anti-cheat  system or just a better report system this game would be great.",False
Waste of money. There are so many hackers it ruins the game. DO NOT PURCHASE.,False
"This game had a lot of potential, but the number of cheaters in this game has increased exponentially to the point where playing this game is pointless unless you're planning on cheating.

To the game developers, stop wasting time making new skins and re-direct everyone to fixing the cheating issue. You won't have a game to develop if this keeps going.",False
"More and more I'm ending up in games with pathetic people hacking. Cannot recommend until this issue is resolved. A shame as it's good silly fun when everyone's playing fair, but when people are literally flying to the goal line and griefing by modifying stats there's just no point.",False
"TL;DR Wait a while before buying this one. Core gameplay is fun, aesthetic is cute, but there are killer issues.

The game is a battle royale with adorable characters, fun customization, and affordable cosmetics that include things you can only get if you've won. It consists of a bunch of mini-games that are reminiscent of Mario Party ranging from races to a team egg collecting fight.

However, I would not recommend playing this game right now as there are a lot of issues with it as it stands. There are many bugs like getting kicked into a lobby when joining a game as a friend or not being able to exit games sometimes. The bugs aren't even the real problem with this game right now.

Cheaters and hackers are running rampant in this game to the point that I've played 5 in the row and had one in every match. Sometimes even two in the same exact lobby that zip around, fly, superspeed, teleport, or whatever else helps them win or taunt other players. Some people don't even have to cheat to grief games, like some people do in certain modes such as the see-saw one where they make it impossible for people to move on. I've seen 20-30 people eliminated at once when there should be more survivors.",False
So fun with or without friends. Fast paced and simple games and doesn't get boring.,True

"This game's so broken it's unplayable at this point. I spend more time looking for matches than actually playing due to servers being so stupidly unstable, I can't play with anyone because my friends keeping being kicked out of our party and this game is still filled with hackers despite the ""anti cheat"". It's not worth the price and it surely wouldn't be worth it even if it was for free.",False
"Game's currently broken. They refused a refund strictly on the basis of time played regardless of playtime being 75% loading screen. The games that require luck are the only legitimate games. Anything that requires skill is up for the client side algorithm to decide. This is not more apparent  than in tail tag, which happens to be voted the game's worst mini-game. All other games are a mix of RNG, player skill, and client side algorithms. It is unplayable for anyone that has decent ping to their servers. Avoid it if you aren't looking for clicks and views.",False
"I would not recommend this game to anyone. 
Although it is generally fairly fun, the game has screwed me over in the most annoying way possible two times, and now I wish I had never bought it. It is unfortunate that I have passed the deadline to request a refund before I was good enough at the game to have this issue.

The problem I have is that both times I have gotten to the top 10 or better, presumably to the last round???? (I wouldn't know as you will soon see), I have been disconnected from the server. I have NEVER had disconnects under other circumstances, just when I am doing really well. What is the point of the game if you aren't allowed to win because you get kicked when you do well? 

To add insult to injury, no prizes are awarded when this happens, so you get nothing for playing well, only crappy prizes for playing badly. I know it sounds petty to stop playing over disconnects but I can't stomach playing the game anymore because it has taught me that there is no point. I can start 30 rounds in a row without issues between new games and surviving levels, but if I do well I am kicked. This really just should not be happening, what is the point of the game if you aren't allowed to succeed when you do well?",False
The game is disconecting all the time and it always bring you back to the lobby when enter on a match,False

Maybe, in the future after more hours, I'll recommend it. 

Because I think there's definently an appeal for a lot of people on this game. But it mostly just makes me frustrated. And I play hard games, that's like, my thing. well sorta.

I'm also not so sure on the microtransactions side of things, I feel weird about all that. but I guess if you wanna look like a soda go and spend another 6 dollars or whatever.

",True
"It is exactly what you see. Wipeout, American Ninja Warrior, Mario party minigames etc. It is extremely fun and does a great job with the win lose system. You never really get the feeling that you lost because you earn kudos (coins) and exp for just playing rounds and respectively get more the farther you make it. Crowns are a great system of currency you only get when you win so there is an actual prize for winning. There are a couple of small easily fixable problems I have with the game. 1, Team games. In season 2 it would be great to be able to choose solo, team, or classic mode with the games respectively being placed in each. Therefor you would have the people who enjoy the team effort aspect of the game earning crowns for their team and the more casual players playing solo with the non team games. There will still be some people out there who like the og style so classic would be what we have now. 2, Seesaw. If you know any popular opinions about Fall Guys, It's probably that Seesaw is terrible. You have the people who understand the game and go on the opposite side too get the side needed up and than you have the people who don't understand a playground toy and stand at the edge until the thing goes vertical and everybody is screwed. I honestly think they should just remove the whole game mode. But besides those two easily fixable issues, Fall Guys is a great game. They are still working on a bit of server maintenance because sometimes it loses connection but it really isn't the worst thing in the world. The server issues are played up by a lot of people and are really not that bad. The Fall Guys official twitter account is extremely active with its community and retweets concept art for skin cameos such as The Witcher, Hollow Knight and recently added Scout from TF2. Over all definitely worth the $20 and one of my favorite online games.",True

"Fall Guys is pretty much what I expected, but not as much of it as I expected.

There have been connection issues which don't help, but that isn't a focus of my issues.

I was excited for this release since it was first announced and have played Transformice on and off for a decade now, being the closest thing I can compare this to. I would currently say that Transformice is the better game for the following reasons:

Round Downtime: In Tranformice you may be eliminated early in a round or complete it well ahead of the rest of the group and have a minute or two of them finishing while you wait. Then you will go immediately to a new round. In Fall Guys if you continue to the next round of a full game you'll need to go through the round elimination screen, the next round selection screen, the loading/game description screen, the stage overview screen, and then the countdown to the start of the round. To start a new game in Fall Guys you need to go through the point accrual screen, back to the home screen, gathering players screen, and then into the screens for every round noted above. In Transformice you immediately load new rounds. If you leave a lobby for a new one you may need to wait the 1-2 minutes for that round to end before joining.

Now, notably, Transformice is not actually a battle royale. Fall Guys will take one group and lead them through multiple rounds in a single game until there is one winner of the final round, as you do in BRs. Still, that design choice is responsible for the multiple added delays between rounds.

Point 2: There's like 10 stages in Fall Guys. That's a ballpark, but I think it might be generous. To release a game like this where after 2 hours you'll have likely played every single individual type of round, and certainly multiple times each is... well it's a weird choice. Even a casual player will likely get the same games multiple times in one setting, especially if they don't often make it through to the last rounds. Transformice had a lot more variety early on, and has since added a huge number of custom player stages to normal rotation. Fall Guys absolutely needs some kind of player designed stage system to hope to keep people interested long term.

tl;dr: if this wasn't a day 1 buy for you, wait until it's on sale and/or there's been some kind of community stage design system implemented. If you love the concept try out Transformice for free. If you love battle royales and this was just a change, I imagine you'll be back to playing what you were before this released inside a week.",False
At first I hated this game but I was addicted. But that feeling and rush... When I won my first game. I haven't felt that feeling since PUBG chicken dinners back when that game was good. 10/10 would recommend.,True

"Fall guys is a fun game, and i enjoy playing it. But unfortunately it has too many problems to recommend to most people i think. The servers are still iffy almost a week after release, the devs had to remove names because of a css bug that they somehow haven't hot fixed, which honestly makes me VERY worried about the future content for this game, if a fix like that takes this long how long are actual new maps gonna take? Also, the content in the game is light, you will play the same games very often. There are a lot of fun ones, but a good amount of bad/boring ones as well.

It really is a fun battle royale but I don't think its one i can recommend to you unless your having an extremely strong urge to play it. I think this game has potential and i don't feel like i got robbed or anything, but i'm not confident the content for this game will keep coming, and the servers haven't kept my faith up either.

The game itself is really fun, but there is a [b][i] huge cheating/hacking problem [/i][/b]. I don't know what kind of sad imbecile would cheat on this game, but I've encountered 3 cheaters so far. 

They have a speed hack/a gravity hack, and in the free for all tail game, they would just get the tail and float up out of the screen. In the team soccer game, they would just run faster than everybody else and could knock the ball into the goal with so much force as to be unstoppable. 

Devs really need better anti-cheat as it's ruining the fun of the game. In the tail game final round, we all just sat there because we can't [b][i] even see the guy on the map. [/i][/b]

What's worse is that there is no way to report these people for hacking. Right now, the game auto-generates a name for everyone, so we don't know who the hackers really are. On top of that, there is currently no report button, so even if we do know who the hackers are, we don't have the ability to report them. 

[h1] I will leave this review [b] negative [/b] until they fix the huge cheating issue going on in the game. [/h1]",False

"Game has problems. There's sections of races where you jump and just hit an invisible wall, causing you to fall off the map and go back to a check point. Another point on Fall Mountain, before final ramp up. There's 3 stairs you jump on, and every time I jump, I slide back 3 feet back down the stairs. but 4 different people jump up one after another no problem. Not one of them slide back. Pretty poor collision physics, especially in a game where that's 80% of it.

Besides the bullshit that happens in this game. It can be very fun with friends, but expect to lose because of the poor physics, and/or childish gameplay sabotage. I would suggest waiting to purchase the game for them to clean the game up a bit - unless you're really looking for a game with friends to just mess around and pass time.

i cant reccomand this game . Fall Mountain is The most Luck Based Finale i have ever seen. Hexa gone is the only Trully Skill based one. and its becoming awful as well because people just always make as many traps as they can just to ruin someone's day . Jump showdown is just luck Based to oblivion.  this game Is fun. When You Dont have To Rely On Pure chance to get ONE win.  A Practice Mode Would be Great.   But untill some of theese issues  Get fixed. i cant reccomand it.  Good thing i didnt waste 20 euros  and just won it via a giveaway,False

"This little game is just wonderful and goofy, yet somehow not overly competitive despite being a competitive game.  Navigating your walking jelly bean around a course with 50+ other players will almost always end up in some hilarious physics-based shenanigans.  I am also a fan of the shop having skins and such you can buy with the crowns you earn either by leveling up or winning the final match, and the more generic currency that is doled out pretty steadily as you play for other cosmetic stuff.  While the option to buy more generic currency is there, I have yet to feel the need to actually need to buy any to obtain whatever skins are out for the day.

"The amount of cheaters absolutely ruined the game for me. Obvious extra height in jumps or straight up just flying or extreme running speed ruins team games and survival games. Glitching balls into goals, sabotaging other players by grabbing them and flying them off the edge. Trying to grab them and throwing the cheater off the edge doesn't do anything since they fly anyway.

Having a form to fill out for these things is not enough. There must be a report button every elimination round so players can report the person in real time. Not everyone will complete a form; they will quit the game and the player base will suffer.

"I've played just shy of 2 hours in this game and it already started to feel repetitive there is not a lot of map variety and thus don't see myself playing this game for more than another 2 hours top. This is the main reason i see for why people should not buy this game as of yet(server issues don't help but i'm not taking them into account). For me personally i also do not like the what feels like the mandatory team fight each game. This team fight often feels like a 1-2/3 chance of winning even if you do your best and for example end with a tail, you might still lose due to nobody else in your team having one, this i feel is extremely frustrating for something that happens to atleast someone each game.

"This game is really fun, no question, but there is A LOT of things that make the experience worse which makes it unplayable. First of all, the game is filled to the brim with hackers, many people just soar to the goal freely. Secondly, the game has so many glitches, such as, in tail tag if I am extremely close by and grab their tail, nothing, if I have a tail, and someones far away from me and grab, they have my tail. It's not hacking because it is 'extremely' common. Third of all, the minigames are 'heavily' based on luck then skill, like Team games, I don't lose because I lost but because my team really sucks, or I didn't get the minigame I wanted because the minigame wheel always picks the same minigames over and over again, or if i'm in the back row. Next, there is no real way to practice the minigames, because they are random, even though the minigames are the same, you can't practice the finale minigames, like Fall Mountain because you 'always' lose before even getting close to the victory crown. Next, all the cometics are really ugly, some of them I like but most of them are really corny. There are many other games that have more value than this one, and i'm surprised this game costs £20, it should be free to be honest. Not worth it.",False

"I would not recommend it right now. There are a lot of hackers, the servers are not working very well. With my friends can play about two or three games before the server shut down with an error message. Otherwise the game is amazing. Somehow stupidly made but so entertaining. I like the game but it's still new and it has some flaws so wait for a couple of months. The game is good and everyone would like it and would have a lot of fun but just wait for a while.",False
Do not buy at this time - Full of hackers - No Report System.,False
"In the current state of the game, I would recommend wholeheartedly against buying this. The game is currently completely overrun with cheaters in 99.9% of games, and the developers haven't been able to implement an anti-cheat which can deal with such obvious and unashamed bad characters who receive zero punishment for what they do. While I don't bash the developers for making a colourful, gorgeous, interesting game which I've been excited for ever since it was first announced at one of the Devolver Digital conferences, I do however bash their seemingly uncooperative nature when it comes to improving the gameplay experience. If you search online for ""fall guys cheats"", you'll find tables for Cheat Engine which allow full unrestricted movement around the level with no server sanity checks. The only way this can be remedied by the players is if people stop playing the game and let it die until the developers implement an anti-cheat system. They can add Cheat Engine checks, minimum round timer checks so people can't teleport to the end faster than a human player could ever finish a level, or even a way in-game to be able to select players and report them instead of having to fill in a form on the dev's website which doesn't give any reassurance the problem is going to be dealt with other than a generic ""your reports make the game better"" email. All this while developers attempt to give the blame to the community using the logic that talking about cheats means that more people will cheat so people shouldn't talk about it. Games are currently either hacked and unwinnable or they're ghost towns because people leave immediately after seeing a hacker. The game could be very fun if the developers did something productive to help out this growing community. Until then, however, this game is not fun and I'd say to anyone looking to pick it up to wait another couple of months to see if anti-cheat is implemented. If not, don't bother.",False

Although being a network based game, the issue is that when it does not work well, you have no fun.

That is no fun at all.

And it is not my connection; I play a ton of other online games and they work just fine. Tried all the tricks in the book until I just gave up. Matchmaking is erratic, the games are fun few times, but then the result is more tied to your luck, your network conditions and who play with you, instead of something more akin of a multiplayer competitive game. This should probably be a free mobile game, for what it offer, it make sense, but if you pay for it, you expect network code to be top notch and you expect to win or lose based on what you do right or wrong; not by randomness.

But if you are a very competitive and ambitious person who plays solo, I CANNOT recommend it currently for you. The game is a diamond in the rough and it shows, it has multiple bugs and at one point even if due to bad luck on my end, the game's Unity engine crashed and led my computer to act wonky and I had to replug my headphones and restart my computer to fix it. This is probably a hyper rare occurrence though. 

And to top things off after the bugs, there are far too many hackers running rampant for a game such as this to be acceptable, I've seen them in more than half of the matches I've played tonight and I see them at LEAST once a day normally. For more competitive people this is infuriating, to get to the last level and see them just flying constantly and winning with no problem, especially since you need to win to gain certain currency in the game.

"I'd really like there to be a ""not recommended, yet"" tag. But oh well.

Fall Guys is a really good idea. A party game like battle royale, whats not to like? And theres plenty of reviews covering its good points.

But here's what bothers me: 
The lack of minigames. For 20€ game, the amount is just not enough, especially considering the simplicity of the games.
After just 3 hours, i have seen most maps, safe for 1-2, and replayed a couple of them close to a dozen times.

This issue is easily solveable, just give people maptools and have folks vote on them. 



Other than that, Fall Guys is quite fun. Theres just not that much to it, and i can see the playerbase dwindling quite fast.",False

I know not a big sample size but look at the other reviews on the amount of hackers. The hackers are extremely obvious as well, completely flying over the map and finishing the map within mere seconds. Is it really that hard to implement a system which bans people who get impossible times?

Gameplay wise its a fun game, reminds me of total wipeout and is really fun to play the minigames.",False
"Its a super fun party game that has a perfect balance of wholesome fun and competetion between your friends.

But I can't really recommend it because this game has a huge hacker problem on pc. Sometimes it feels like theres a hacker every other game, and it kinda ruins it for me. The excitement of possibility of winning is definitely a large part of this game and having a hacker in your game completely ruins it. 

This last game I was in, the hacker was going out of his way to knock people off of the ledge which ruined it. 

Imma leave this at negative until theres more things in place to take care of hackers, because as of now i don't think theres anything.

this game provides zero acessability features or setting making it near imposable for players like myself to keep up with the crowd.

i also have complaints about:
- how slow the runing speed is in a game thats supposed to be fast paced chaos. the developers should at least provide a sprint option.
- my character falls over for seemingly no reason when theres no one else or no obstacles in the way.
- way to many loading screens and establishing animations/shots. the levels are so short, ive spent more time outside them.
- after being eliminated you can leave to main menu during the elimination screen but if you dont you have to wait through all of the slow loading screens and cut scenes until the next level loads in spectator mode be fore you ca leave.
- theres a significant lack of variety in levels and gameplay content but way to much skins and customisables
- its very hard to see whats happening. the player charcter dissapears in the crowd and the animation isnt very clear with whats going on.

I bought it for insane 20 euro and it's like an alpha game with a bunch of bugs.
i you don't believe me, just check the discussions and you will see. A LOT of problems.
But I don't want to say empty words, so here my experience:
(My specs: 1050 Ti, i7-7700HQ, 8GB ram, 970 EVO SSD)

1.  There were a LOT of cheaters in the game when I played, you literally can't win any game because it was 90% you will get a cheater. (Now it's fixed, unfortunetly, I still not able to playbc of other reasons shown below)
2.  A bug, where if you reached the final round, you were instanly disconnected, no matter what. (It fixed now, but imagine the stress, when you reach a final without a cheater and you got disconnected)
3.  A bug, when you got automatically disconnected from every second round, for no reason. Good to know, I have a really good innternet with no other game problem. (It's kinda fixed now, but the servers still a shit with big latency)
4.  Desptie the fact this game doesn't requires really strong specs and my PC can run most of the modern games, I always got lag for 1s when starting a round, so i always have a disadvantage when starting a round. (medium/low settings)
5.  The worst problem. The lag. I got huuuge lag spikes%fps drops in every second or third round, which means I have 3-4 fps for like 10-15 seconds for no reason. I say it again, on medium/low settings with my medium specs which meets the requirements. Or just got random fps drops to 10-15 fps for like 2-4 seconds. (It's still not fixed and can't get answer for my problem.)
6.  I can't get a refund because I have 20 hours and bought more then 2 weeks ago so it's rip for me.

"[u] Some good things about Fall Guys: [/u]
[list]
[*] Chaotic but fun and challenging mini games, with a good variety of them
[*] A pleasing art style and colours, as well as great soundtrack and sound design
[*] Easy to learn the controls, but challenging enough if you want to master the game
[*] No pay-to-win mechanics, most outfits/theatrics can be bought without real money
[*] Nice and colourful graphics, and is very optimised for low-end PCs
[/list]

[u]However, a couple of things that need improving:[/u]

[b][u]Team Games -[/u][/b] In it's current state, I personally don't think team games are suitable for this style of game. Don't get me wrong, team games CAN be very fun to play, but players are almost unable to communicate with each other, so for most team games there's no control. I don't know how to improve these mini games, I'm not a game designer at all. But I believe they could be much more improved if players have a way to control how a team game is played

[b][u]Hacking/cheating -[/u][/b] It is WAY too easy for cheaters to hack and get away with it. I've seen players sometimes using speed hacks, but most commonly players simply flying all over the map to avoid elimination. There needs to be a way to report players and/or an anti-cheat system

[b][u]Server lag -[/u][/b] This is mainly due to the game's current popularity (as well as a round having up to 60 players in it), so there could be no way to control this. I have no idea if Fall Guys uses server regions, but if not I highly recommend it does so


Overall, Fall Guys has a lot of potential to become a big game. I believe Mediatonic has done a very good job with making this game, and I'm very excited for what is added to the game in the future. This review is purely from personal experience, so feel free to take it with a grain of salt",True

epico,True
"Game CAN be fun. It's not fun by design, and it will most likely frustrate you once you start playing for a couple hours.

It's a game that is DESIGNED to be competitive, yet it adds a bunch of random and aleatory BULLSHIT that disrupts the core gameplay, making it feel more like a gamble each time you play instead of rewarding skill.

Keep in mind that the game EXPECTS you to win constantly or regularly, or you won't be able to purchase some of the cosmetics from the store. This means that a big part of the available content is restricted, and if you just can't achieve a victory, you are missing out.

Think you can just GET GOOD? In theory, yes you can. You can become amazing a all the minigames, but some factors will mess you up on your way to your crown. Mainly:

1. Latency issues. The server sucks if you're not located on NA (or wherever the other servers are located) This makes games involving balls and tails usually UNPLAYABLE, for the fact that you won't be able to hit the ball properly (the position of a ball on your screen is definitely NOT where the ball is located on the server, meaning you're just a potato and unable to help your team push or defend) This also means that people are able to take your tail from you from far distances. Just because the opponent is far from you on YOUR SCREEN doesn't mean they aren't close to you on the server. This is bullshit.

2. Unresponsive inputs: Sometimes I've reached the last minigame only to lose because I sent a jump command and the game decided not to trigger it. This has already happened in at least 7 finals. Again, just plain bullshit.

3. Minigame selection doesn't make sense: 12 people sometimes triggers a last minigame, other times it takes you to a ridiculous team game to reduce the player count even more. The lack of consistency is outstanding.

4. Team games are just a luckfest. Not much to say about this one. Try all you can, you won't be able to make a difference if your team is full of bots.

Playing with friends makes the experience ENJOYABLE and DECENT. Not much else after that. You will get tired of playing certain minigames because they just waste your time, are boring, or they are plain unfair (memory game, soccer game, hoops game)

This game also suffers from the Super Smash Bros. Brawl Syndrome, which is creating a competitive game and adding mechanics that sabotages player while they play (in the case of SSBB, the tripping mechanic) If you jump and touch another player, or they obstruct your jump, you will fall flat on your face, and will be unable to stand up after a certain amount of time, That can get you killed in multiple situations, or leave you far behind enough for you to miss the player threshold. They should polish the physics and interactions between the player to allow for smooth control of the characters, at least in my opinion. That would make the game more skill based instead of luck based. Keep in mind that tripping in Brawl was added to ""nerf"" good players and allow casuals and noobs to be able to punish a player for something that is out of their control. The mechanics in this game are going against the core of the gameplay, which is to be the best player in the room. Too much luck is involved in each minigame for this game to be considered a proper Battle Royale.

Finally, cheaters. If this game has an anti-cheat system, it sucks. Whenever there's a cheater, it's time to either leave the game or hope for a team game where the team with the cheater can grief and sacrifice themselves in order for the cheater to lose. That's still a gamble though, and it just wastes your time cause you have to leave and re-join later. Again, more bullshit to the pile.

These guys just made a ton of money from this game, so hopefully they'll be able to keep the experience fresh and polish this garbage to the point where it becomes enjoyable. Right now, all the factors I just mentioned make this game frustrating, and not fun to play. I don't even play by mylsef anymore, I just hop on when I have my friends with me, and even then, after less than an hour it's time to move on to something else cause it becomes repetitive and boring.

Don't give them more money until they fix this dumpster fire. Wait up, hopefully they will polish the game to make it worth your money.",False

Joke explained: I don't actually have a pet chimp and I lied for the sake of comedic affect of something that is entirely out of the ordinary. The floor tiles joke was a play on words with the word ""flawed"" being turned into floored which relates to the hexa-gone floor tiles in the sense that they are spelt the same, hence the joke which was made for the sake of a simple belly laugh from the reader.

"Don't play this game if you want to win. From the random server disconnects, hackers, boosters, griefers, and the worst of all RNG, the game is impossible to play. First off, it seems like the playlist is broken because I usually get 1 team round every 10 games. It usually goes like this: Big solo game --> Slime Climb --> Fall Mountain (or Fall Ball --> Fall Mountain). 9/10 of all my games went by this format. 

The problem is the game can't be competitive because despite the pattern of rounds repeating so much, all 3 of those are games in which you can lose for no apparent reason that isn't your fault like bad spawn, desync, physics fails, and other random events that are beyond the player's control. And because I only play 3 or 4 of the same rounds with some others peppered in here and there (haven't played jinx since the game came out), the game isn't varied enough to keep playing.

"Lol, I've only played this for one hour and I've already created a list of issues. A TLDR is that this game is pretty fun but I just can't seriously recommend it since this should, at best, be either Early Access or in a closed beta program. This is not a finished game worth $20.

[*] Team games are fucking horrible. This game is fun until your streak is ruined because now you're in a team. I see that some people are suggesting separate queues for solo/team games and I think this is a great idea. The team games are fun, but just not when you mix them in with solos and have them ruin your round because you can't carry for 5 other people.
[*] This game is really just luck/rng in disguise. Skill is only part of the equation and most times it doesn't amount to much. As I've played I've learned new things and recognized levels. An easy strategy you'll quickly learn is to focus more on other players than the map. See where the least amount of people are going. Look for holes in the crowd. But other than that and getting familiar with the controls you're pretty much on a luck joyride. Some games do require skill, though, like the tail grabbing game, but let's talk about those. Even though a lot of it is luck you can win pretty easily once you get the hang of it. I've been winning a few games though I've never won on the final round, but it's still clear that skill or no skill your chances are about the same.
[*] Whoever designed the networking for this game is laughable. There are people with obviously stupid pings flying all over the place making it impossible for their tail to be grabbed. And even when you're standing directly behind someone you still can't grab it because of some sort of lag.
[*] On my first launch of the game I noticed the music sounded weird. Turns out it was playing the in-game music three times over at the same time, each track being a few seconds off. Really off-putting and a horrible presentation of the game for a first launch. Restarting the game seemed to have fixed the issue.
[*] With resolution set to 2160x1440p 143hz and vsync off the game ran at 60FPS. Turning vsync on made it run at 144FPS. Uh...wut?
[*] You cannot leave a game unless the game is in session. During loading screens, map introductions, countdown, and presentation of the winner, you cannot open the pause menu. Why?
[*] Also I haven't seen any hackers yet but apparently it's a rampant issue. So that's a big no no, too.

The content feels incomplete and for a game costing 20 euros/bucks its insane how they feel its appropriate to include a F2P shop Scheme where an item takes several hours to get access to.

And they then implement a Fear Of Missing out to try and entice you to pay for their Overpriced currency in the game just like F2P games does.
Its predatory and manipulative for a pay to play game.

This is not even mentioning how if you pay for their currency you are litterally spending 5 euros to 7 euros for 1 part out of a 2 part costume. The color scheme does not work on the costumes either, So they can do a simple color swap down the road and charge you extra for it ofc.


Honestly i dont even minded that the servers were complete trash at launch, I can get past stuff like that.

"* Servers are still broken and I don't think there is any excuse to it. Why are we always accepting games that fix themselves later in their shelve time? If publishers and developers expect me to be ok with it then they should make the game an early access product.
* Progression system is a joke, this is a Devolver published games ladies and gentlemen and they always make fun of and crticize this type of monetizations/microtransactions. Yet here we are progressing to unlock color palettes.
* This game is not FUN. It is just sometimes FUNNY and thats it.
* If you think you will have fun with your friends. Well good luck with that, there is zero benefits to playing with your pals. I would say there is actually very severe disadvantages. If you are down, either you have to watch them play or they have to exit the game. You might be thinking ""that's ok, you lost deal with it"", thats true in some sense but I think watching your friends must get you some percentage of progression and that is not the case.
* There are apparently total of 24 mini-games right now. I think I saw most of them and approximately half are just variants, either team versions or rehashed versions. Currently the level generation is very much broken. You only get a few of them (3-4) in the beginning levels and I don't think that's very much a requirement, the team based games and even some final levels are easily adjustable for starting levels. Starting levels should be the most diverse ones, right now it gets old real quick.
* Most of the levels are unbalanced and obviously not play-tested. Remember the beta? I think that was all the play-testing this game got before launch. There are barely any mechanics your avatar can use and they aren't reliable most of the time, you are just wobbling around through random luck.

How would it be fixed right now?
- The servers obviously.
- Much much more reliable physics and new mechanics, crouch/duck mechanic for example.
- New and different games. Team based games are fun but there is just too much randomness in everything.
- Get rid of the color progression system... This is just not a good color on you Devolver.
- A game mode that gets rid of the elimination system and introduces ranking would lessen the frustration I think. You would rank yourself through 2-3 times the amount of games that is right now and the final games would be best out of three added to the previous ranking.

I don't think this game in it's current state deserves any money . This was a big Twitch bait and we fell for it. Don't fall guys.",False
"Edit 01 09 2020
As of today the server issues have been getting worse and worse. If the initial problem for fall guys being too 'laggy' was because of the huge amount of players than they expected then you would think that with the hype being gone and dramatic drop in total number of players would make the server connections better, but no. Server issues is now so bad that when trying to find a game you have to search for it multiple times as they will constantly disconnect you from the search due to 'connection issues'. Sorry but the developer for this game is not taking their job seriously and one should only be buy at a discounted price or never. This game will die out sooner or later.


Edit 26 08 2020
We had our first update today for fall guys. Supposedly they had change the algorithm to ensure that teams are even but that's a lie as teams are still uneven very often. Hackers have dominate the game, constantly winning the games and the only way to beat them is to pray and hope for them to be in a team game and hopefully beat them.. Oh yeah guess what, they screwed the update and now every player couldn't get their rewards whether they win or lose. Great game, great game indeed.

Edit 19 08 2020
Just today, the server issue has become so bad that even when I got my victory, I had a server error from getting my rewards and never receive despite them saying I would received it next log in.

While fun, server issues and hackers are ruining the game very badly. Players constantly have to deal with latency and syncing issues in physics intensive games such as the soccer team game with their balls constantly bouncing or tail tags, where players have to catch other players and steal their 'tails'. Disconnection from servers is also a common problem.

They also used to have a report a hacker system but it was removed due to them implementing their 'anti-cheat' system but clearly that is not working out.

Team games are terribly managed; teams are often unbalanced and games are constantly fought between a lesser numbered team against a higher numbered team.

Maps and game modes are also severely limited, while advertised as a game with multiple type of game modes, chances are you will playing the same few games over and over again so expect super repetitive gameplay.",False

-something should be dont with the jumping/standing up as well.Havent seen anything that implemented that your character gets heavier or not with skins or anything like that.So its kinda anoying when your character falls even on flat surfaces(cause why not i guess) and than it cant  get up.This becomes easily a problem on the dont fall of survive map(block party for example),where you should jump over the obstacles,but you bean decides to fall over instead of landing on its fleet.Even if it stood up, the game says no no you cant jump anymore because the wall is coming and someone needs to fall,even through youre already standing.YOu just have to accept your death basically.
-and the hackers of course.you dont get as many is in a cod ,or cs game but still.(btw its fucked up when 2 cheaters play then end map)
-also it would be really nice if the game wouldnt freeze any time i press the leave match button too fast after loosing.Love it how it either freezes,and looses connection, or it simply doesnt notice that i left that match and bugs the sound out(hearing the music from the old match and the new at the same time)

it gets frustrating to play very easily with thing like that tbh......
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Its a good and fun game in the begining,but once you play more you see its issues.

Bad:
- The ragdoll is a mess sometimes,so your character falls for no reason,or simply acts like a 80+ year old elderly and cant get up.
- Dont know if its the games hit detection,ping or cheat is it,but in the tail games sometimes they can grab you from meters away and get the tail.Interestingly its the opposite if its you,since sometimes youre literally grabbing the person with the tail yet it wont detect it(?) that youre on it so you dont receive it(or its just ping issue,or server?) .
- Team games.... oh boy......Sometimes it feels like the average iq drops down to 30 in them,but only in your team.Instead of eliminating the enemy team they grab you the same colour one,stop you,slow you and so on.Completely forgeting that its a TEAM based map they just run and act like headless chickens.( To be fair this might change as more and more people will learn how to actually play the game). But still when youre lucky you get a good team,and you with one of the enemy team kill of the third one(egg scramble for example)
- Some maps need balance as its becomes a mess really easily.Its a funny one,till you realize you cant do anything since you keep falling over while everyone jumps/pushes you all over the place
- Kinda needs more maps modes,I know thats theyre coming,but you start to feel the need of them pretty early since the rounds dont take that long
- Needs some work with the play with a friend option since its preatty bare bone at the minute.Not seeing  the name at the end,if they finished or not and so on.I know that i can see an arrow above the head,but thats pretty much all.
- Cheaters are in this game as well for some reason,but  not too many YET.Hope there wont be more as they fix this problem asap.
-the battle pass is kinda grindy if youre not wining that much tbh


Good:
- Its a Fun game still,even with the issues.
- On some maps the ragdoll and the physics are a joke,but still manages to be fun in the end.
- Kinda competetive, if youre into that
- Some maps are really good
- Even if you hate it,once you played it you kinda want to play more :D . Its a love/hate realationship   
- Still has a great potential with new maps and modes

In the end its still an enjoyable fun game withs issues that can be fixed.So i recommend it still",True

"As a Kid, I love Total Wipeout and Takeshi's Castle!

Fall guys is a mix of the two. Fun gameplay, Losing made fun and addicting.

The problems I have are that the team games and grab games are sometimes frustrating.

The currencies are also pretty good. Kudos being the less valuable one and Crowns being the rare currency except you need to win or progress through the seasonal pass to get them. Crowns can be used to buy legendary skins like the Scout from TF2. This makes it to where you grind game wins and XP to get the skin you want and not shelling out money to get what you want.I like it as it adds value and feels like a game with unlockables earned through gameplay.

The character design is basic but great at the same time as it is basic enough for people to make ideas and fan art on specific game franchises and everyday items to show off to everyone. I love it

All and all, this game is great if you want a break from sweat inducing games like Apex and Rainbow Six Siege. 

Highly recommend 8/10!

1. Bugs, bugs, bugs. I paid 25€ to become beta tester.

2.Servers are nonstop down and if they are running you get sometimes disconnected in the middle of game. 

3. Almost in every game there is 1 or more cheaters (speed hack or fly hack). Its unbelievable how easy you can cheat because there is no report system or anti cheat and all you need if cheatengine. Yup its that easy

4. Lack of maps. There should be 24 maps but for some reason i feel like im playing 10 of them over and over again.

5. Oh boy and dont even think about winning in this game because there are team based minigames. Most of the time you end up with team of apes who scores their own goal or just people who are sick of this team games so they are afk. Next great thing is uneven teams.

"[quote][h1]Full video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAbhTvUu1_c
Summarized version below![/h1][/quote]
Now this is a unique battle royale. 60 players, a gauntlet of wacky games, and one ultimate winner. It's one of the simplest battle royales I have ever played, but it's also one of the most fun.

[h2]Gameplay:[/h2]
So I'll start right off with the gameplay. If you haven't already seen the numerous streams or videos of this game, it's a pretty simple concept. You're slapped down into a game full of 60 players and proceed to run through a bunch of different games to whittle that number down to just 1. Unlike other battle royales, there is no ""buildup"". You don't spend a bunch of time searching for loot only to die after doing that for twenty minutes. In Fall Guys, you are on the exact same playing field as every other player. The only thing holding you back is any potential RNG by the map and the other players running alongside you.

It's a refreshing battle royale in this way. You're always in the action and there's no time spent waiting around. Of course, your success is largely dependent on how every other player acts. You can easily do an almost perfect run only to then get stampeded on by 20 other players trying to reach the goal, tripping you over and over until you're eliminated. There's a lot of mobbing, a lot of tripping over other players, and even players attempting to grief you via grabbing. It sounds unfortunate and I'm sure many complain about this aspect of the game, but honestly, that's what makes the experience work so well. It's what separates each match from one another and makes the game more than just ""who has perfected the map the most"". I quite liked this setup and it's large part of why the experience never got old for me.

[h2]Amount of content:[/h2]
However, something I can see bringing down the game with time is the lack of content. There's a decent amount of game types as it is, but I wouldn't say that it's enough to carry the game for maybe more than a couple months. The fact that the main menu says ""season 1"" leads me to believe that more games are going to be added with time, but that's something that the devs really need to get on top of if they want to keep the game alive.

That is on top of the fluctuating quality of those different games though. There are some really standout ones, like Slime Climb and Tip Toe, but then you get ones like Perfect Match, which is a just a simple memory game that I have only ever seen eliminate maybe two or three players max. Favorites are definitely going to differ from person to person (especially with regards to team games, which I at least thought were decent), but there are some games that are obviously not up to par with others.

[h2]Technical issues:[/h2]
And I should mention the technical issues. Over the past several days I have been playing the game with friends and have gone through numerous disconnects, server issues, and other connection issues preventing us from playing as a full lobby. It usually takes two or three cycles before we're able to all actually connect to the same game.

This isn't just me either, as this is evident in the massive amount of people that leave at the beginning of the first match, many of which I imagine are running into the same issue. Of course, a lot of this has to due with the sheer volume of people playing during launch week, but it's still something that needs to be noted. Other than that, the experience has been relatively bug-free, with the sole bug I ran into being the time I fell through the game map and wouldn't respawn.

[h2]Graphics/art:[/h2]
Before I close out the review though, I gotta talk about the game's aesthetic. For the kind of casual, yet crazy gameplay it offers, the graphics and overall art direction are a perfect match. Its simple, its colorful, and there's a good amount of customization to be had by way of the different outfits and colors you can equip. Sure, it's unfortunate that microtransactions are present, but at least it's just cosmetics and you can still earn the same currency by just playing the game.

[h2]Overall:[/h2]
Overall, I'd say Fall Guys is worthy of recommendation. It's a simple concept, but it's one that's executed well and I've had a good time playing it with friends since its release. The devs really have a good base to build on here too. So long as they keep the game updated with new content, this is definitely going to be a party game I'll keep coming back to. Perhaps this may even evolve into its little esport, we'll have to wait and see.

You need to smoke a cigarette after the round because of how yellow and red f'd you so hard like I'm not even joking. In egg scramble, you could just look away from your basket for a second, and red and yellow all be up in there, and sometimes blue doesn't do anything about it.

This isn't a free-to-play game so get your microtransactions out of your non-playable game since you cant be bothered to fix your damn servers issues that ""justify your microtransactions"".

Team games shouldn't exist, it removes all elements of skill at this point if you get bad teammates and there are even some games that you can AFK for half of the duration and it wouldn't matter at all. You also sell top and bottom parts of the costume for what? Another sign of greed there because you can buy Kudos to spend on those top and bottoms parts. This isn't about customization, if you really wanted customization then you can easily sell them as a whole package but still have two parts. This was just an excuse for you to promote buying Kudos. You remove Steam names and replace it with generic garbage because of UI breaking and displaying profanity? Like wtf is even really wrong with you people. You made a great game yes, if I will only judge it from gameplay but that also has some serious flaws but I will judge this game as a whole and it's really bad. Microtransactions in a paid game, unplayable servers and very bad executive decisions like banning steam names. Otherwise then it's a pretty fun game to just mess around with but unless they fix their crap then this review stays.

"It's a fun game in short bursts, but right now, the mini-game selection is too small and some of the team events like the Egg one are just incredibly frustrating and monotonous.

Also, for 2 days in a row now, every time I logged on, there was server maintenance preventing me from even playing the game. Come on guys, you did an open beta and knew this game was going to be popular. Locking people out for extended periods due to your own mismanagement is not a good look.

Right now, I can't really recommend it. I recommend waiting for the mini-game roster to be improved and for the matchmaking issues to stabilize. £15.99 is simply too much for the lack of content on offer right now, regardless of how fun it can be.",False
"fall guys is about falling guys that have fallen for the guise of the guys that will not fall like the rest of the fallen guys that fell in the fall, guys.",True
"Was fun for the first couple hours but there's too little skill involved, too much chance, and too many team-oriented game modes which end up being unbalanced (literally 5v7) for some reason.

I expected dozens of variations to these courses but it seems like there are maybe 5-10 different courses total?

Seems like it's really just for little kids.",False

fun,True
In my eyes the only Battle Royale game with a right to exist.,True
"It so fun with friends and has really high potential in the future, for example, they can add custom lobby/local multiplayer/ranking system, etc..., however, the game severely under pressure which leads to lag/disconnecting and that lead to unpleasing gameplay.

someone pushed me off and i lost,True
"It is a really fun game. Some people do not like the team games, and i can see why since you lose because of ""other people"" (it is never you're own fault ofc, you yourself played like a god). But the experience of team games is more fun then the races i think!",True
"it good
it fun
it worth $20",True
"Seriously underestimated their serverload. Fun game, but cannot recommend it until the server issues are fixed. spending hours of waiting for a connect is too annoying. Sorry, but this is a NAH for now.

UPDATE: Big Update today, problems worse than before.",False
I am unable to finish an episode because between level transitions it disconnects me from the server at random. Unplayable.,False

"Play this game, it's most fun I've had in months from a video game",True
"The dev say they are being review bombed because people write negative review about the servers not being stable enough to actually play the game... I paid to play a game that I can't access, so those reviews are justified

On top of that, they ask people to ""reserve review bomb"" by giving positive review to counter the people that warn about the server issues? That's dishonest! 

This is why Steam implemented a way to view the reviews per period of time. When you'll fix your server, the positive will come back naturally.

With that said, the game in itself is really simple, not that much involved and frankly, 30 minutes and you've done all there is to it",False
best game to play with friends. Best BR EVER,True
F U C K,False
yes yes yes,True
Endless fun and such a laugh I would defo get this game!,True
"It was only really fun the first time I played, not it has just gotten redundant and annoying. The lack of content wasn't noticeable at first  but became very apparent fast. I really wanted to love this game, but at this current state I can't. Team games should not exist at all, period. If you spawn in the front row, you're almost guaranteed to qualify see saw. The constant sound of the jelly beans running into each other is ridiculously headache inducing but to turn it down you have to turn down the other sound effects too. The progression system is cool, the cosmetics are great, the little content that there is is mostly good. Just for the love of god don't only release new content at the start of every new season. ATM it's not worth $20, more like $5 or $10. Most people have been whining about the servers, but what do you expect when they do a closed beta and put content creators into it the generate hype for the game and then proceed to not realize how much hype they generated.",False

i can't start the game!!!!!,False
"Update 10 hours in, made a few changes to the review but mostly everything mentioned remains unchanged, I'm still having a blast with Fall Guys.

[h1] Servers [/h1]
As someone who played right at launch, the servers were fine. For the two hours or so I played directly after launch, the game was smooth, matchmaking was quick, and there were no noticeable server issues. Beyond launch, I will admit the servers have had some issues, I've had the occasional server dropout which can be really frustrating especially when it happens right before a crown game, but overall no huge issues.

[h1] Shop [/h1]
The first thing I noticed was the shop system, expecting that a full costume would cost 8-10 dollars like every other popular game right now, I was delighted to see that every costume (at least at the time of typing this) was about 1-2 dollars and all items (minus the dlc outfits) could also be purchased simply by playing the game. A full outfit would probably take 1-2 hours of playing. In this landscape of overpriced skins, it was really refreshing.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Getting into my first game was easy, and as I mentioned before, quick. The gameplay itself is fun, and the minigames felt varied enough for my taste. Considering there's 25 of them in rotation, and I haven't seen them all yet I don't see repetition being an issue unless you play the game for a very long time. Although even if repetitiveness was an issue, the fact that you can unlock the shop cosmetics simply by playing is enough for me to grind out some currency, which brings me into my final topic.

[h1] Cosmetics [/h1]
The cosmetics are awesome. They are unique, cute, fun, well designed, etc. I could easily see myself seeing something I want in the shop, and not stopping until I get it. I'm the kind of person that will deal with repetitive things if the reward is good (I play Destiny after all) and the rewards in Fall Guys are definitely good. 

I'll give this a solid 8/10, although the team games can be a little annoying when you are on a good streak with solo rounds, this is a super charming and fun little game, and one that I easily recommend.",True
"Good music
Fun minigames
Ingame currencies where you dont need microtransactions
Lots of customization
Free updates to come

This is a fun Battle Royale.",True
"Pretty great with a group of friends. Few bugs but still, pretty great overall",True
fall guys more like fart guys,True
"Great game, the premise allows for hours upon hours of fun and the developers could endlessly create new modes to keep the game fresh. over all I believe that they made a game that has been attempted before but finally perfected it.",True
"Bought this game few days before release. Was waiting for it and it was released whole hour after time it was promised... So played only 15 minutes because had to work. In the evening tried to play again but wasn't able to... It is looking for more players for 30 minutes already. Tried to relaunch game, didn't help. Can't recommend it until they fix their servers.

UPD:
Played for a few hours now. Game is fun but only to some extend. Team challanges are the worst thing in this game. Half of the time I get eliminated bocause my team does nothing. Also it's weird to have team challenges when you can't communicate and coordinate with your team.
Anyway after few hours game becomes all the same with limited opportunity to win due to team events which turns it from competition into luck based win most of the time.

I thnk devs need to either remove team challanges completely or make them only for players in party. Also number of good solo challanges is small and repetitiv.

All in all I don't recommend this game right now. It is luck based, repetitive and overpriced for it's current content.",False
"it was really fun at the start but now its just a griefer and hacker infested game. i played 16 hours the first 2 weeks and its actually unbrearable to play now. this game had its chance, but thats over. the physics are buggy, the servers are broken half the time, the costumization is extremely limited, the ui is bad. the game is repetitive and i dont get why there would only be like 12 levels, where only 2 are somewhat playable. its riddled with speedhackers and griefers so just give up if a hacker is in your game or a griefer is at the finish line in slime rush or whathever that level is called.

if you are looking for bad reviews, just read this:
play the game for 2 hours, and refund it. trust me, if you dont refund it, you will eventually regret it. btw, the collectors edition is a scam, and even the standard edition is a scam. its an overrated game and im done with this shit forever.",False
"Good game, but alot of errors. Im sure they will fix it since the game just came out, thats why i still think its a good game. Its fun and enjoyable with your friends :)",True
"Takeshi's Castle really is fun as a game, even if its a lot more buggy than the real thing!",True
"I had some fun during my first 2 hours of gameplay however there are some basic issues which just completely ruin the game for me:

1) The game has constant disconnects 1 in 3 games you play you can guarantee your going to disconnect. 
2) A bug where your in the game, there is no disconnect and it just takes you to the start game screen. [This has occured twice]
3) Checkpoints don't always work right.",False
this shit is so much fun,True
Best Battle Royale!,True
"Well made game that i cant get enough of! Many ways to differentiate yourself through customisation. Fun and wacky level designs. Good soundtrack and you can play it with your friends! The devs are involved with their community through the means of discord and twitter, something other high-end games don't do! Overall pretty good playerbase.",True
very fun and competitive especially with friends... i 100% recommend buying this game.,True
"This game is extremely fun and a nice break from the usual ""Drop in, loot, shoot"" style of these games. I know it just released today but it is one of the most fun games I've played in a while.",True
Fun to play & they keep working on this game,True
"[h1]The Turn Around[/h1]
If you read my previous review I just couldn't recommend the game with the greatly increasing cheater problem, server issues and reward errors. Well September 15th came and the Mid-Season update arrived, which included some cool changes to the existing episodes, but most importantly it brought Easy Anti Cheat. Now I can't say for sure if you'll ever see a cheater in the game again, but I can say that since the update, I haven't seen any. The cheater problem was really bad to the point I was seeing them almost every game. Since the update I also haven't had any reward errors which were happening a fair amount of the time and I've only experienced one disconnect on the day of the update. I hope that things remain this way and as it stands right now I can recommend the game.",True
